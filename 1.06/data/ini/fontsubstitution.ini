; Font substitutions go in here
; Format is :
 FontSubstitution "SachaWynter"   ; Substitute requests for Albertus MT font

    Size 9 = 12 "Omnia LT Std"
    Size 10 = 14 "Omnia LT Std"

; The Font manager will interpolate sizes between adjacent values, and will always use the font name specified for the value less than
;  or equal to the font size requested. Values are clamped to the lowest and highest sizes specified
;
;  i.e. in the above example
;   Requesting 9pts or below, will return 10pt Arial
;   Requesting 10pts, will return 10pt Arial
;   Requesting 15pts, will return 13pt Arial
;   Requesting 22pts, will return 17pt Arial ( because it uses the font name from the lower size, but still interpolates between the two values )
;   Requesting 24pts, will return 18pt Times New Roman
;   Requesting 72pts, will return 36pt Times New Roman

;  [amm] 11/03/04 - Bold/NoBold extension
;     In order replace a font with a bold version, use +BOLD before the font name, i.e.
;        Size 10 = 10 +BOLD Arial    
;      Would replace with 10 point Arial Bold.
;   Similarly, -BOLD can be used to specify that requests for Bold version of the source font, should be replaced with non-bold substitution font. i.e.
;        Size 10 = 10 -BOLD Arial
;
;
;
; The following font substitution is to replace all ocurrences of SachaWynter font with a tightened up version which has also replaced the digits
;   with fixed space versions
;FontSubstitution "SachaWynter"
;    Size 1 = 1 "Omnia LT Std"
;    Size 500 = 500 "Omnia LT Std"
