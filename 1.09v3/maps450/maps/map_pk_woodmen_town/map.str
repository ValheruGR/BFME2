"The oldest settlement of the Woodmen was founded by the folk of Balthi long ago. He brought the Lamp out of the darkness, and the light of the Lamp has ever protected Woodmen-town and its inhabitants. The town nestles on the banks of the Enchanted River, which blocks attacks from the east. The Woodmen also use the river to travel back and forth between Woodmen-town and Woodland Hall.\n Map by Powerkartoffel"
