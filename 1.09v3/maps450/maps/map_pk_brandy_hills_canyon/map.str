"This is an area north of Buckland along the eastern shores of Brandywine River until the Brandywood. Girdley Island is the only named point of interest of these hills though they are dotted by small Arnorian ruins. Some young hunters may be seen hunting bears and boars taking shelter in those ruins. \n Map by Powerkartoffel."
