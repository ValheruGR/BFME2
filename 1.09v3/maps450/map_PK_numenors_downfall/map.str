"'For Melkor's sake! Why won't this rain ever stop?' Cursed Kevin. Once again, he failed. His 5th attempt with the rotten wood to make his farewell-from this god-forsaken island. He was the prodigy of Numero's boatman's trade guild, designer of the "Azrubel", a ship with a wide hull and narrow waterline which made the journey to Belfast in 4 weeks. And now THIS... 'Stop swearing! I can't take this anymore; I'm going to gather wood with Johan.' Sarah van Botenbirken, the firstborn of her house, ran away from her father to marry Kevin and start a new life.

The island nation had turned into a gray collection of ruins, dead hopes, and crushed dreams. The old woman takes a drag off her cigarette and sung a line from her favorite song from the Sauron Youth program, "there is no sunshine, just dark clouds with an endless rain of tears...
