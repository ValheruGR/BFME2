SCRIPT:MBTutorial_MissionText76
"Remember, select your army and right click on the enemy units to issue attack orders. You can select one battalion at a time and issue them attack orders to specific enemy battalions."

And into this ring, he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life. One Ring to rule them all. He used this ring to conquer Middle-earth and enslave its people. But through the encompassing darkness, there was still hope that heroes would arise to challenge Sauron."
