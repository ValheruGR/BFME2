"The island of Numenor was a great civilization of Men that was destroyed due to their pride and rebellion against the will of the Valar. The once-great land was swallowed by the sea, leaving behind only haunting ruins and semi-flooded islands as somber reminders of the folly and transgressions of men. \n Map by Powerkartoffel"
