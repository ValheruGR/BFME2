"An old lady sat by the sea, and all her tired eyes could see were the remains of her home being swept out to sea. She reflected on the Fall of Numenor when Sauron sent his mighty host; his many white vans were ever watchful as they abducted the nation's youth. Offering free tattoos, gauges, and CDs, Sauron eroded the trust between father and son, replacing the once rich culture with Eru Iluvatar's homosexual fantasies. Slowly but surely, as they rebelled against their poor parents whose love was no match for Iluvatars corruption, the nation soon crumbled as his main forces raped the land in its state of weakness. The island nation had turned into a gray collection of ruins, dead hopes, and crushed dreams. The old woman takes a drag off her cigarette and sung a line from her favorite song from the Sauron Youth program, "there is no sunshine, just dark clouds with an endless rain of tears...  \n Map by Powerkartoffel"
