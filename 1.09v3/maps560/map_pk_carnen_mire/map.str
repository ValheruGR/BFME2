"The River Carnen originated in the Iron Hills and was east of the Lonely Mountain. It flowed southward before emptying into the River Running, which was about 250 Numenorean miles to the south. This river, in turn, flowed past the land of Dorwinion and into the Sea of Rhun. \n Map by Powerkartoffel."
