[color=#ff5e0e][b][size=5]New Patch Switcher[/size][/b][/color]

[color=#008575][size=4]1. Instant, Efficient, and Error-Free Switching[/size][/color]
Despite using Python, which is known to be slower than other programming languages, Switcher will only perform system copy/move operations on the files that actually require it, allowing for faster switching than ever before. In case of an error, Switcher will tell you exactly what’s wrong and attempt to provide a solution, such as automatically closing BFME2 or Worldbuilder processes that may prevent the switching of files.


[color=#008575][size=4]2. Check for Updates Feature[/size][/color]
Switcher is now properly linked to the 1.09 GitHub project, from where 1.09 developers can easily add either switcher updates, patches or utilities. Users can then download and install updates through the "Check for Updates" button.


[color=#008575][size=4]3. New Patch Customization Support[/size][/color]
You can now add your own hotkeys, maps, and textures in a separate and portable folder without destroying the original patch files, making it easy to set it up on a new computer. Simply install the game, install Switcher, your PlayerCustomFiles folder, and that's all you need to do to start from scratch.


[color=#008575][size=4]4. New Status Health Checker[/size][/color]
There's a flag in the center of Switcher that detects patch mismatch issues and ensures that everything works as expected.

[b][size=3][color=Blue]Blue Flag: [/size][/color][/b]
Your game and your patch should work without issues. Clicking it performs a new scan.

[b][size=3][color=Orange]Orange Flag: [/size][/color][/b]
Your game files do not match with your customized files or the selected patch. Clicking it performs the necessary switch actions.

[b][size=3][color=Purple]Purple Flag: [/size][/color][/b]
Your game has missing configurations that prevent it from starting. Clicking the flag fixes the startup crash issue by creating an options.ini file with your desktop resolution.

[b][size=3][color=Olive]Olive Flag: [/size][/color][/b]
There are mod files(.big) in your game installation that could potentially cause a mismatch. Clicking it will ask if you want to delete the strange file or allow it (in case you know what you are doing). In case you regret allowing it, you can reset your switcher settings.

[b][size=3][color=Red]Red Flag: [/size][/color][/b]
The only flag color that should worry you. It will show up when there is a BFME2 or a patch file missing. In this case, you will have to reinstall either the game or Switcher, depending on what the red flag tooltip recommends. Clicking it will provide information about the exact missing file. (Eventually the switcher will attempt to download the missing file from github).

[color=#008575][size=4]5. Includes[/size][/color]

[b][size=3]Cracks for Every Version: [/size][/b]
You will no longer require mini images to play without a disc, nor manually a crack. All you need to play this game is; the game and the switcher. That's all.

[b][size=3]Zoom-Out for Vanilla: [/size][/b]
Considering the original zoom is 300, 450 Height Zoom-Out was added to 1.00/1.06: This is enabled by ticking the "zoom-out" checkbox. (1.09 Patches are 450 by default and 560 when zoomed out)

[b][size=3]Auto-Defeat Fixer:[/size][/b]
The famous anti-piracy "feature" of BFME2 where you are literally defeated after four minutes, no matter the game type, is fixed.

[b][size=3]Out of Memory Error Fixer in 1.09v2 and 1.09v3: [/size][/b]
BFME2 is an old game that, despite your high-end computer specs, will most likely get out of memory crashes after a long game when you are playing with high details or a high resolution. This fixer basically adds a flag to allow the game to utilize a bit more ram memory, decreasing the amount of crashes you could have.

[b][size=3]Legacy BT2DC Support: [/size][/b]
This allows you to watch old legendary replays, even those from bt2dc patches to 1.07/1.08 patches.

[color=#ff5e0e][b][size=5]Patch 1.09 V3.0 Summary of Changes[/size][/b][/color]


[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]

[color=#008575][size=4]1. More High Quality Maps & Reskins[/size][/color]

Like every major update, Patch 1.09 Version 3.0 brings a wealth of new maps tailored for all team sizes. Special recognition goes to Powerkartoffel, our primary mapper, who skillfully utilized 1.09 resources to create maps that are nothing short of awe-inspiring. These maps breathe new life into the game, to the extent that you might mistake it for a modern masterpiece.

[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]

[color=#008575][size=4]3. New Hero Abilities[/size][/color]


[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-205669-1704221550.png[/img]
[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-205669-1704221546.png[/img]



[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]

[color=#008575][size=4]4. More abilities improve at high levels[/size][/color]


This concept was introduced already in previous Patch 1.09 iterations. Now we are extending it to even more heroes and units.

* Arwen Flood changes at level 4, 7 and 10.
[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-205669-1704221520.png[/img]
[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-205669-1704221516.png[/img]
* Elrond Whirlwind changes at level 5, 7 and 10.
* Witch-King war mace changes at level 5 and 8.
* Saruman Wizard Blast changes at level 4 and 8.
* Fellbeast causes wider attack damage at level 6.
* Mithlond Sentries run faster at level 4 and 7.
* Eowyn Smite changes at level 4 and 7. 
* Eowyn Shield Maiden changes at level 7.

[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]

[color=#008575][size=4]5. Upgrade cost varying by unit[/size][/color]


This concept was also introduced in 1.09 iterations, but now it was extended even further. 

* Heavy Armor price for archers is highly reduced.
* Basic Training for low cost units no longer cost more than the unit itself. Banners for your orcs is a thing now.
* Fire Arrow costs vary by archer type.
* Forged Blades also depend on the unit, Goblin Warriors pay a lot less than Half-Trolls.

[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-205669-1704405423.png[/img]



[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]

[color=#008575][size=4]6. Geometry, pathfinding, combat behavior, chasing mechanism reworked[/size][/color]

This concept was also introduced in 1.09 iterations, but now it was extended even further. 

* Farm construction no longer demands more physical space than their real geometry.
* Fixed Dwarven Undermine placement radius.
* Fixed hordes melee-chasing other hordes.
[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-205669-1704221525.png[/img]
* Hordes are now less likely to get stuck or decide to take a large detour when walking around enemy hordes (horde geometries are now cylindrical and smaller).



[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]

[color=#008575][size=4]7. Reworked the Cavalry flanking system[/size][/color]

It is known that BFME2 Cavalry rely on flanking to deal maximum damage against enemy hordes. But some hordes are completely immune to it. And certain elite units do not deserve to be one-hit. 

* Hordes such as Corsairs, Haradrim Lancers, Hobbits, Wildmen or Rohan Elven Warriors now have the possibility of being flanked, from not flankable at all. Flanked duration now 1000 from 0 (Default is 4000).
* Pikemen flank duration reduced (1000 from 4000).
* Gondor Soldier in Shield Wall formation flanked duration reduced (2500 from 4000).
* Lorien Warrior flanked duration reduced (3000 from 4000).

[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]

[color=#008575][size=4]8. Fixed glitchy units movements[/size][/color]

* Shelob movement is now smooth (credit to RotWk 2.02).
* Gorkil scorpion no longer stutters.
* Mounted heroes chasing single units (credit to Miraak).
* Spider Riders turnaround now performed in a smaller space.

[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]

[color=#008575][size=4]8. Proper anti-walls system[/size][/color]

In BFME2 walls are immune to everything except SIEGE damage types. This means very few units of this type can damage them, and those who can, have to destroy wall segments individually. Since 1.06, BFME2 worked around this by adding splash damage to some Catapults against Walls. But there are still a lot of units that could receive something similar. 
* Now every monster and flying unit causes splash damage against walls.
* Battering Rams, Demolishers and even Grond cause splash against walls.
* Ensured every Fortress Catapult causes splash damage against walls.
* Walls are no longer immune to fire damage, so certain abilities and units can cause damage against walls, including Wyrm.
* Tier 4 spells cause high damage against walls; Dragon Strike, Earthquake, Flood.

[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]

[color=#008575][size=4]9. Fixed classical scams[/size][/color]

[b]* Ranged abilities can no longer fail: [/b]
	Lurtz Cripple, Gimli Axe Throw, Legolas Hawk Strike can no longer fail, at the cost of a range nerf. 
	
[b]* BloodThirst:  [/b]
	After 19 years, since the release of BFME1, BloodThirst from Mordor and Isengard has finally been fixed. Now it does actually make you level up and gain damage/health accordingly. Sacrificing your orcs to become level 10 is now a thing, trust me.
	
[b]* Fire Arrows:  [/b]
	Every archer Fire Arrow or Silverthorn upgrade will now provide by default +35% arrow damage, plus the usual flame damage, but now the fire is also more effective against units and heroes. Traditionally Fire Arrows only added flame damage without modifying pierce (except for Gondor Ranger, who gains a similar arrow improvement since 1.06). 
	
[b]* Dragon’s Nest and Signal Fire healing:  [/b]
	In 1.09 it was intended that Dragon Nest would heal Drogoth. But in BFME2, units auto heal do not stack. So once Drogoth starts healing by himself, he cannot be healed by another source, like the Dragon Nest or Signal Fire. Certain players would manage to work this around by forcing the Hero/Flyer to attack something, so the Fortress/Signal Fire would heal it. But now this is no longer necessary, at the cost of a nerf. Dragon Nest healing will only work once Razors Spines are also purchased. The same will occur with Eagle Nest + Mystic Fountains, allowing to heal any kind of flyer.



[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]

[color=#008575][size=4]10. More fixes and quality of life changes[/size][/color]

* Healing level 1 Monsters: Despite 1.09 adding a lot of autohealing for monsters around level 2 or level 3, when you have a 0.0001 hp attack troll there was nothing you could do to heal him. Now you can heal them by purchasing Lava Moat or Razor Spines. It will be very slow, but now there’s something you can do to save that monster.
* Lava Moat, Boiling Oil, Magma Caldrons upgrades can now actually kill heavy armored units, but it’s dodgeable as damage is caused slowly until reaching the maximum range. And as far it is, the less damage. So a player not paying attention can lose his upgraded army, but a sharp one can dodge it. (Maximum damage now 1200, minimum 360, from 600/600).
* Gimli is now effective against upgraded armies. Leap can kill heavy armored pikes in the very epicenter, but in the outer area units survive. 
* Thranduil's Wild Walk ability is now passive yet still has his own stealthed FX.  Stealth ability on allies now has a cast FX. Thranduil’s health has been increased, armor has been improved against pikes, build times reduced.
* Fixed BattleWagon Archers not properly shooting while moving.
* Fixed Mumakil permanent terror state, which makes it move faster. (usually caused by Black Arrows, or terror abilities).



[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]

[color=#008575][size=4]11. More Cavalry horde changes[/size][/color]

* Banner Carriers can now be trampled, but they are twice as strong against Cavalry damage.
* Mounted Banner Carriers are now considered an actual cavalry unit, which makes them able to fight and crush like a cavalry unit, as well they now have cavalry armor and receive crush revenge.
* Less chances for Cavalry to crush Pikemen without receiving crush revenge. Previous 1.09 versions ensured Cavalry trample did not kill Pikemen, but there was still one more thing to fix: Pikemen not causing damage to Cavalry.
[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-205669-1704221554.png[/img]



[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]

[color=#008575][size=4]12. Interface Changes[/size][/color]

* Ensured that most of the units, monsters, machines and heroes display their damage so players can see the effect of buffs, abilities or level up. (units that cannot show reliable information because they have multiple weapons will not display anything).
* Added a maximum zoom of x1.25 for players who use the !RemoveZoomLimits exploit. (in RotWk it is x0.86)
* Leadership Tooltips simplified:
	1. «LEADERSHIP» is the most basic modifier. Anything can cancel it. 
		Example: «DEBUFF» cancels «Armor LEADERSHIP»
		Example: «DEBUFF» cancels «Damage LEADERSHIP»

	2. «BUFF» means resistance to debuff. Only Isengard Freezing Rain can cancel it.
		Example: «Armor BUFF» can resist «DEBUFF» 

	3. Identical modifiers don’t stack with each other.
		✅Example:  «Damage LEADERSHIP» + «Armor LEADERSHIP»
		✅Example:  «Damage LEADERSHIP» + «Damage BUFF»
		🚫Example:  «Damage LEADERSHIP» + «Damage LEADERSHIP» 
		✅Example:  «Damage LEADERSHIP» + «Armor BUFF»

	4. Anything without a tooltip means it stacks with everything (except itself) and cannot be debuffed.
		Example: Elrond Athelas, Mighty Rage, Ivory Tower.

* Horde Bonus SXF: players can now see when horde bonus is actually applying. 
[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-205669-1704221573.png[/img]

* Dwarven Rebuild FX: Since 1.09 Rebuild provides Armor on structures for a few seconds, now you can see the FX while the bonus is active.



[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]

[color=#008575][size=4]13. Creeps[/size][/color]

* Fixed Veterancy Upgrades having chances to not level up hordes.
* Veterancy Upgrades now uses the model from BFME1 Moria.
* Creep Fire Drakes are now weaker and the lairs now provide four Treasure Chests from three.
* Creep Spiderlings are now weaker against Structures and Builders. 
* Creep Goblin Archers no longer attack Structures.
* Gollum health reduced to 9000 from 12000.

[color=#008575][size=4]14. Improved Spellbooks[/size][/color]

* Dwarven Lone Tower is now castable on units and causes a small knockback.
[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-205669-1704221558.png[/img]
* Wyrm is now optionally controllable, becoming a serious threat against anything if properly managed. Reload time increased to be like any other tier 3 Spell.
* Elven Sunflare now causes more damage against Structures.
* Flood, Earthquake, Dragon Strike now cause higher damage against Fortresses.
* Evil Heal now replenishes two units per horde (becoming a highly attractive choice to use on your Spider Riders).
