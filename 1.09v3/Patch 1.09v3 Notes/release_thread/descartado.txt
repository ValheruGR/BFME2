A plethora of unit damage/health gains have been reworked. In BFME2 damage/health gains are by default additive and similar among units of the same type. Which means a level 10 Goblin is around x4 times stronger, but a level 10 Berserker is x1.3 times stronger. This is interesting because it implies weak units are worth keeping alive, but it causes the opposite effect on units like Half-Trolls or Berserkers.
* Berserker damage/health gains have been improved.
* Spider Riders, Half-Trolls health/damage gains improved.
* Basic Archers (not elite) damage gains in high levels are reduced.

Also, health-damage gains are now properly distributed between the 10 ranks. Since the addition of level10 batallions in 1.09, their health/damage gains have been generally half than the gains between level 2-5.
