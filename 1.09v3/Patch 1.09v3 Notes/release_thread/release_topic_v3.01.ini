[b][size=6]BFME2 Patch 1.09 Version 3.01 has been released![/size][/b]


[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-205669-1704397056.jpg[/img]


After half and a year of 1.09 v3.00 feedback, here we are releasing new patch update with players feedback. The Patch Switcher will automatically prompt you to update your patch and the BFME2 Arena is now syncronized with the new patch update. We are also adding even more maps and a special set of FFA maps designed specifically for the first internal FFA Lord of the Ring themed tournament ever.

[color=#008575][size=4]1. Modularized patch support[/size][/color]
Now you no longer need to download 2gb of patches just to play the latest 1.09. Just download the patch switcher and specify the patch you want to play.


[color=#008575][size=4]2. Legacy patch management interface[/size][/color]
Now you have access to download in 1 click that legacy BT2DC or even 1.09 Beta versions to be able to watch that nostalgia replay you have have saved from older times.  



[color=#008575][size=4]3. New Shortcut/Hotkeys syncronization tool[/size][/color]
Now you can build your own hotkeys only once and with 1 click, apply it to every patch, allowing you to see the intended tooltips of any version while preserving your shortcuts setup. Note that Styhx KeyBinder already allowed you to do that, but now you no longer have to do it per every patch you play or anytime there's a new patch.

[color=#ff5e0e][b][size=5]Patch 1.09 V3.0 Summary of Changes[/size][/b][/color]


[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]

[color=#008575][size=4]1. More beautiful maps and new textures[/size][/color]

Like for every patch update, BFME2 1.09 keeps brining new maps with profound emphasis on aesthetics and gameplay. Like usual, the king of mapping, Powerkartoffel, has prepared us a bunch of new maps to refresh the atmosphere of this game, worth of a BFME3 if it existed. AndyBrandy, a professional player since the www.clanwars.cc times, has also started to map and brought us a dozen of new beautiful creations. Also a texture pack has been adding to the patch so mappers can design even more beautifuil new maps.
