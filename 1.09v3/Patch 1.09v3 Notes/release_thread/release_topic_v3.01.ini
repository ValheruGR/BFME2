[b][size=6]BFME2 Patch 1.09 Version 3.01 has been released![/size][/b]


[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-205669-1755343383.jpg[/img]


After a year and a half of 1.09 v3.00 feedback, we are now releasing a new patch update based on players’ input.
The Patch Switcher will automatically prompt you to update your patch, and the BFME2 Arena is now synchronized with the new patch. 
We are also adding even more maps, along with a special set of FFA maps designed specifically for the first internal Lord of the Rings-themed FFA tournament ever.

[color=#ff5e0e][b][size=5]Patch 1.09 V3.1 Summary of Changes[/size][/b][/color]


[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]

[color=#008575][size=4]1. Once again, new and beautiful maps[/size][/color]

Like every patch, BFME2 1.09 brings fresh maps with focus on both looks and gameplay. The master mapper Powerkartoffel prepared many new maps that make the game feel almost like a BFME3. AndyBrandy, a pro player since the old clanwars.cc days, has also started mapping and shared more than a dozen amazing creations. A new texture pack was also added to the patch, giving mappers more tools to create even better maps.
