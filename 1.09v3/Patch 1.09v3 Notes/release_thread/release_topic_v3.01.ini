[b][size=6]BFME2 Patch 1.09 Version 3.01 has been released![/size][/b]


[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-205669-1755343383.jpg[/img]


After 20 months of 1.09 v3.00 feedback and 6 of intensive beta development, we are now releasing a new patch update based on players’ input.
The Patch Switcher will automatically prompt you to update your patch, and the BFME2 Online Arena will be synchronized with the new patch. 
We are also adding even more maps, along with a special set of FFA maps designed specifically for the first internal Lord of the Rings-themed FFA tournament ever.

If you already have patch 1.09 v3.00 then you don't have to worry much, all community launchers platforms will automatically drive you to the new release.
