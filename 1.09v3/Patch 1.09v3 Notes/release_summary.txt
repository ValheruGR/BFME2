	-1.09 v3 Summary of significant changes..
		Radical Shit of new patch.
			-Wyrm - Rain of fire.
			-Saruman & Sharku.
		1-Horde vs horde pathfinding improved. hordes don't get stuck while walking and surround enemies without taking retarded directions.
		2-Banners and upgrades costing different per unit. (like 2.02 did but it is not tiered and icons can be multi-executed in one command)
		3-Reworked the way damage/health is gained to slow down the snowball effect of a level4-5 unit in a early game. (1.09 dmg/health gains are high in the first 5 levels then they are minor)
		4-Gandy, Wk, Rohirrim nerfs
		5-Mallorn lvl2 armor	(MineShaft and Farm already do this since 1.09v2)
		6-Berserker halftroll and spiderider dmg/health gains are now more significant. 
		7-Berserker autoheal at 3 from 5.
		8-EvilFortress can now heal monsters but it is extremely slow. Now u can save ur 0.001 hp troll.
		9-Spiderling can now chase anything including orcs or corsairs.
		10-Spiderider, GorkilScorpion and Shelob now have an improved locomotor (Shelob locomotor stolen from 2.02)
		11-Arwen flood changes at level 4, 7, 10, casting more flood horses.
		12-Tier4 powerpoints more significant, enough to make a fortress look damaged. (EQ, Flood, DS, etc)
		13-Wyrm controllable but reloads slow
		14-Mordor ugly meteorite spell now consist on 3 meteorites fired for during a second and occupy bigger radius
		15-BattleWagon, Cavetroll and Attacktroll can now purchase heavy armor.
		16-Gimli leap now has ultra concentrated high dmg in its epicenter to one hit 4-5 units every time.
		17-MightyCatapult from citadel now 5 rocks from 4.
		18-Sharku new lvl10 ability summon 3 wargs hordes of 5 with armor
		19-Saruman blast now have ultra concentrated high dmg in a tiny and close-to-saru radius to onehit (same concept than gimli leap)
		20-DragonStrike now comes faster and improved vs bases aswell, but reloads slower like any other 25pp.
		21-Every siege attack have splash damage against wall (baterring rams, trolls bash, ents punchs, grond, etc)
		22-Mumakil doesnt deal splash dmg vs units if attacking a building unless u right-click a unit (meant for dwarves to evacuate while a muma is attacking)
		23-Fellbeast becomes stronger in level 6, matching a texture change that makes him black.
		24-Saruman new lvl10 ability (badass like 1.09v2 one but being ranged with concentrated high damage)
		25-Unused fortress upgrades being cheaper like floodgatesa and minelauncher.
		26-Sounds like hobbit or ent summon are now considered as music to avoid copyright shit in youtube if you play without game music
		27-Every unit displays damage in portrait and it also representates the effect of leadership but also forgedblades.
		28-Mounted banner carriers now properly behave like a cavalry unit, crushing decelerating and everything
		29-Leadership tooltips ultra simplified
		30-Heroes that give 50% dmg now give 35% or 40%, so using RallyingCall above these heroes is not entirely useless.
