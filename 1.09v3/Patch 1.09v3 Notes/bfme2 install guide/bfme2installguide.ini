[size=4][b]1. Download the game[/b][/size]

[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1624018618.png[/img]

[size=3][b][i]There are two options to download the game:[/i][/b][/size]

[h3][/h3]
[size=2][b]A. Either download a vanilla BFME2 ISO[/b][/size]
	・[b]Mirror #1: [/b][url=http://www.mediafire.com/file/4heo0ipvahha2yd/tBfMe_II.iso/file]http://www.mediafire.com/file/4heo0ipvahha...fMe_II.iso/file[/url]
	・[b]Mirror #2: [/b]

	・[b]Pros:[/b] Comes with all the game features, including World-builder and supports all available languages for the game.
	・[b]Cons:[/b] Weights 4GB, it will ask you a original copy Key and there may be a crash when trying to launch it on windows 10 for first time. Although there's a solution for all that on this topic.
	・Traditionally you would have needed to burn a .iso file on a DVD. Or emulae with a virtual disk through applications like WinCDEmu or DaemonTools. But, today, any compressor app like WinRAR or 7zip can extract it directly. Then you can simply run the "setup.exe" file and proceed with the installation.

[h3][/h3]
[size=2][b]B. Or download BFME2 Special Edition[/b][/size]
	・[b]Link: [/b][url=http://forshire.blogspot.com/p/download-bfme-ii.html]http://forshire.blogspot.com/p/download-bfme-ii.html[/url]
	・[b]Pros:[/b] Easier and faster to install, weights only 2GB, doesn't need mounting, fixes the crash at startup and has new music from The Hobbit.
	・[b]Cons:[/b] Game is ripped which means certain game features & assets are deleted, such as non-english support files or World-builder. Another problem is that it comes with a old patch 1.07 version.

[size=4][b]4. Fix the game for windows 10[/b][/size]

[size=3][i](This is not necessary if you downloaded BFME2's Special Edition)[/i][/size]

[b]If your game crashes in any version, run the fixer[/b]
	・Link: [url=https://www.moddb.com/games/battle-for-middle-earth-ii/downloads/bfme-startup-fixxer]https://www.moddb.com/games/battle-for-midd...-startup-fixxer[/url]
	・Download, open it and click fix BFME2.


[hide=[b]If your game STILL crashes on loading screen do this:[/b]]
1・Go to [i]"C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Roaming\My Battle for Middle-earth(tm) II Files"[/i] and ensure [i]"options.ini"[/i] exists and is not empty. 

[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1499173801.jpg[/img]







2・If it doesn't exist, you can download [url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_o8VV6LL_FXV0Y2a210eEFhZUk/view?usp=sharing] this one[/url] and paste in the mentioned folder. If the folder doesn't even exist either, just create it. 


3・You can either manually set your game resolution by opening [i]options.ini[/i] with notepad, or just press 'Fix My Resolution' in the patch switcher. If you want to do it manually just go to this line and edit it to your preferred resolution. Then simply save it. You can change it in game but it only has a set amount of resolutions and doesn't support 1440p and 2160p, so if you are on high-res monitors this is the only way to do it.
