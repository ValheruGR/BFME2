[size=4][b]1. Download the game[/b][/size]

[size=3][b][i]There are two options to download the game:[/i][/b][/size]

[h3][/h3]
[size=2][b]A. Either download a vanilla BFME2 ISO[/b][/size]
	・[b]Mirror #1: [/b][url=http://www.mediafire.com/file/4heo0ipvahha2yd/tBfMe_II.iso/file]http://www.mediafire.com/file/4heo0ipvahha...fMe_II.iso/file[/url]
	・[b]Mirror #2: [/b]

	・[b]Pros:[/b] Comes with all the game features, including World-builder and supports all available languages for the game.
	・[b]Cons:[/b] Weights 4GB, it will ask you a original copy Key and there may be a crash when trying to launch it on windows 10 for first time. Although there's a solution for all that on this topic.
	・Traditionally you would have needed to burn a .iso file on a DVD. Or emulae with a virtual disk through applications like WinCDEmu or DaemonTools. But, today, any compressor app like WinRAR or 7zip can extract it directly. Then you can simply run the "setup.exe" file and proceed with the installation.

[size=2][b]B. Or download BFME2 Special Edition[/b][/size]
	・[b]Link: [/b][url=http://forshire.blogspot.com/p/download-bfme-ii.html]http://forshire.blogspot.com/p/download-bfme-ii.html[/url]
	・[b]Pros:[/b] Easier and faster to install, weights only 2GB, doesn't need mounting, fixes the crash at startup and has new music from The Hobbit.
	・[b]Cons:[/b] Game is ripped which means certain game features & assets are deleted, such as non-english support files or World-builder. Another problem is that it comes with a old patch 1.07 version.

[b]You could also try Radmin VPN[/b]

Radmin is a VPN similar to Hamachi but with no chat and much larger number of users in the same network.

Usual players tend to prefer it because conection seems to be better between players. However, you will have to arrange your games through another platform, either Discord or GameRanger.

Here's a bunch of networks created exclusively for BFME2 1.09:

Network: Cow&Pig
Pass: 123456

Network: BFME2 GAMEREPLAYS
