1. ### Instant, Efficient, and Error-Free Switching
Despite using Python, which is known to be slower than other programming languages, Switcher will only perform system copy/move operations on the files that actually require it, allowing for faster switching than ever before. In case there's an error, Switcher will attempt to provide a solution, such as automatically closing the BFME2 or Worldbuilder application processes that may impede proper switching.
	
---


2. ### Check for Updates Feature
Switcher is now properly linked to the 1.09 GitHub project, from where 1.09 developers can easily add Switcher or patch updates. Users can then auto-download and auto-install updates through the "Check for Updates" button.
	
---


3. ### New Patch Customization Support
You can now add your own hotkeys, maps, and textures in a separate and portable folder without destroying the original patch files, making it easy to set up on a new computer. Simply install the game, install Switcher, add your own PlayerCustomFiles folder, and that's all you need to do to start from scratch.
	
---


4. ### New Status Health Checker
There's a flag in the center of Switcher that detects patch mismatch issues and ensures that everything works as expected.

- **A. Blue Flag:** Your game and your patch should work without issues. Clicking it performs a new scan.
- **B. Orange Flag:** Your game files do not match with your customized files or the selected patch. Clicking it performs the necessary switch actions.
- **C. Purple Flag:** Your game has missing configurations that prevent it from starting. Clicking the flag fixes the startup crash issue by creating an options.ini file with your desktop resolution.
- **D. Olive Flag:** There are mod files in your game installation that could potentially cause a mismatch. Clicking it will ask if you want to delete the strange file or allow it (in case you know what you are doing).
- **E. Red Flag:** The only flag color that should worry you. It will show up when there is a BFME2 or select patch file missing. In this case, you will have to reinstall either the game or Switcher, depending on what the red flag tooltip recommends. Clicking it will provide information about the exact missing file.

5. ### New Buttons

- **A. Resolution Handler**: You can save your custom resolutions here, which is useful for those who frequently change their TV or display settings.

- **B. Garbage Cleaner:** It is designed to find and delete unnecessary or unknown files from your BFME2 installation folder.

- **C. Links to BFME2 online communities:** GameReplays, Discords, and the hotkey changer website. 

- **D. Launch Game and Open Its Replays/Maps Folders:**
	
---

6. ### Includes
- **A. Cracks for every version:** You will no longer require mini images to play without a disc, nor manually a crack. All you need to play this game is; the game and the switcher. That's all.
	
- **B. Zoom-Out for Vanilla:** Considering original zoom is 300, 450 Height Zoom-Out was added to 1.00/1.06: This is enabled by ticking the "zoom-out" checkbox. 

- **C. Auto-Defeat Fixer:** The famous anti-piracy "feature" of BFME2 where you are literaly defeated after 4 minutes, no matter the game type, is fixed.

- **D. Out of Memory Error Fixer in 1.09v2 and 1.09v3:** BFME2 is a old game that despite your high end computer spects, will most likely get out of memory crashes after a long game when you are playing with high details or a high resolution. This fixer basicaly ads a flags to allow game to utilize a bit more of ram memory, decreasing the amount of crashes you could have.

- **E. Legacy BT2DC Support:** This allows you to watch old legendary replays, even those from bt2dc patches to 1.07/1.08 patches.

## <center>  **More High Quality Maps & Reskins**<center>

<br/>


<center> Like every major update, Patch 1.09 Version 3.0 brings a wealth of new maps tailored for all team sizes. Special recognition goes to Powerkartoffel, our primary mapper, who skillfully utilized 1.09 resources to create maps that are nothing short of awe-inspiring. These maps breathe new life into the game, to the extent that you might mistake it for a modern masterpiece. </center>

<br/>

## <center> **New gameplay features**<center>
<br/>

Version 3.0 took the liberty to add a bunch of non conservative features to aggionate the game while also dealing with late-game balance issues or serious bugs.

1. ### New heavy armors
	You can now upgrade the following units after you purchase the usual heavy armor technology in your armory type of building.
		- *Dwarven Battlewagon*
		- *Goblin Cave Troll*
		- *Mordor Attack Troll*
		
2. ### Horde-converting abilities redesigned
	It was figured that this abilities can cause a serious bug regarding the transference of negative commandpoints. No solution could be found in BFME2 nor Rotwk, so we opted to simply replace it or make it permanent.
	- **Sharku Tame the Beast removed**
		- Replaced by "Summon Warg Riders", which summons 3 hordes of 5 heavy armored Warg Riders.
	- **Saruman Corrode Allegiance is now permanent**
		- Ability was also moved to level 10, instead of 8.
			
3. ### Redesigned and new abilities
	- **Saruman Thunder Bolt Storm** 
		- It still has a badass special effect like 1.09v2 one, but instead of being a Word of Power like ability, it is now a ranged ability with highly concentrated damage capable of destroy heavy armored units from the distance.
	- **Arwen heal is back** 
	- **Eowyn is now designed as an anti-heroes type of unit.**

## <center> **Quality of life improvements**<center>
<br/>


1. ### Improved general pathfinding and combat behaviors
	- *Fixed Goblin's Spider Riders, Shelob, Gorkil movement, which is now smoother.*
	- *Fixed melee-chasing mechanism. Now you can chase, for example, orc warriors with your own infantry or spiderlings*
	- *Improved battallions pathfinding behavior around enemies. They are now less likely to get stuck or decide to take large turn around to surround a enemy unit.*
	
2. ### Proper anti-wall system
	- *Every siege type of unit now cause splash damage against Walls, so wall spam can now be properly countered with monsters, spellbooks or any type of siege machine*
	
	
3. ### Things that used to be a scam
	- **Bloodthirst**
		- *After 19 years, BloodThirst from Mordor and Isengard has finally been fixed. Now it does actually make you level up and gain damage/health accordingly. Sacrificing your orcs to become level 10 is now a thing, trust me.*
	- **Fire arrows and upgrades for certain units**
		- *Upgrades now cost different for every unit, depending how effective it is. The forged blade that cost 300 for a HalfTroll, might cost 150 for a Goblin Warrior*
		- *Fortress expansions like Flood Gates or Mine Launcher became cheaper*
	- **Razors, LavaMoat, DragonNest supposed healing:**
		- *Every Fortress house of healing can now heal any monster. Despite being very slow, you can now save your 0.0001 health cavetroll.*
		- *DragonNest healing Drogoth is now fixed, but is also heals any kind of flyer now. However, you need Razors for it to work. EagleNest and MysticFountains do the same.*
		
4. ### Match up frustrations revised
	``* Mumakil no longer causes area damage against units while it is attacking a structure.`` 
		This allows units and heroes to defend structures without dying by indirect damage. Now you can evacuate dwarven mines without dying on the way.*

## <center> **Experience Levels rework**<center>
<br/>

1. ### Health/damage gains system has been reworked
	<center>Since the extension of the max rank cap from 5 to 10 years ago, the standard was that units would earn the health/damage from vanilla, but then in the new levels 6 to 10, units would only gain half of those attributes.
	<br/>
	Now, the atribute have been evenly distributed around the 10 levels. This means that the snow-ball effect of having a level 4-5 unit in early game is reduced, without altering the total improvement once you reach level 10. Which depending of the unit, can imply a x2 or x3 total improvement.</center>

2. ### Units with insignificant health/damage gains were improved
	<center>In BFME2, the weaker a unit is, the better the damage/health gains are. This means a goblin warrior in level 10 is aproximately x4.0 times better than in level 1. Or certain archers are x2 or x3 times better than in level1. 
	<br/>
	But this also means the stronger the unit, the worse damage/health gains. Strong units like Berserkers, HalfTroll or SpiderRiders would only become x1.10 or x1.20 better when reach level.
	<br/>
	In RotWK 2.02 they got rid of this issue by making damage/health gains multiplicative years ago. But it is too late for BFME2 without breaking the current balance, so damage/health gains were manually improved/fixed in a relevant way.
	</center>

	- Berserkers, Halftrolls, SpiderRiders now gain better attributes
	- Axe Throwers, Gondor Archers now gain worse attributes

3. ### Special abilities or modifiers unlocking system
<center>This concept was introduced already in previous Patch 1.09 iterations. Now we are extending it to even more heroes and units.</center>

	- Arwen Flood changes at level 4, 7 and 10
	- Elrond Tornado changes at level 5, 7 and 10
	- WitchKing war mace changes at level 5 and 8
	- Eowyn smite changes at level 4 and 7
	- Saruman Wizard Blast changes at level 4 and 8
	- Fellbeasts cause wider attack at level 6**
	- Mithlonds Pikes run faster at level 4 and 7

## <center> **Models, SFX and Sounds**<center>
<br/>


<center> Regards, bambi </center>


- *Horde bonus FX*
- *20 new sounds*
- *Balanced the volume and sound type categorization of previously added sounds. (Music from ent summons or hobbits is now considered as Music, which you can mute when you stream BFME2 and don't want to get your video muted due copyright inflictions)*
- Added a eowyn disguised on foot model

<br/>
<br/>

## <center> **Leadership System Tooltips simplified**<center>
<br/>


- *Most of the units can now display their damage, so you can see the effect of leveling up or leadership modifies.*

- *You can assume everything stacks with everything, but:*
	-*Modifies don't stack with themselves.*
	-*Modifies don't stack with other modifies of identical categories AND identical name*
- *Any kind of LEADERSHIP reference means it can be debuffed* 
- *Any kind of BUFF reference means means that ONLY FreezingRain can cancel it*
- *Any modified without category specification means it cannot be debufed and stacks with everything (except itself)*
