BFMEII Patch 1.09 Version 2.0 is one of the largest patches we've ever developed. It was the result of 116 different beta builds over several years. We've taken great care to remedy the last few difficult matchups that existed in 1.09 Version 1.0. It also comes with many other goodies not related to balance.

## <center> **New Leadership Stacking System**<center>

![Image 32](https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png)

<center> In comparison to Version 1.0, 2.0 has added new cast effects for spells such as rallycall, warchant, mighty rage and more. Also, there is now a revamped leadership system which allows certain damage and armor leaderships to stack that previously didn't (and some that are now immune to debuff). One such example would be Theoden and Rallycall (or Boromir), shown below as solo visual, and then stacked visual. This enables more interesting early game mechanics and player choices. You can see in-game tooltips for more information and we will likely publish a guide to it in the near future. </center>

<center>Beautiful remakes of RallyCall, Warchant, and even cast effects for spells which never had any, such as MightyRage. Dwarven RallyCall now shows as gold to differentiate it from Men and Elves, given its different bonus.</center>
