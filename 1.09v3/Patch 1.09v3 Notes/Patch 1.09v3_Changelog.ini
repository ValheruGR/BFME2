	-IsengardSaruman WizardBlast knockback heroe chances now 15%/25%/35% at level 1, 4, 8. (From 25% being the best improvement)
	
	-IsengardSaruman WordofPower ability replaced by a ThunderBoltStorm, which is a ranged ability instead of AoE.
	-IsengardSaruman ThunderboltStorm each individual hit can freeze MordorBalrogs (and other spellbook monsters like Dragon) for 500 milliseconds, causing the electrified animation from BFME1 Moria Mission.

	-DragonStrike not managing to exit the map when casted in the map sides, getting stuck and damaging permanently beneath him, fixed. As consecuence, the straffe area had to be reduced.
	-DragonStrike debuff speed reducer is now considered a Stun like Grima poisonous words, therefore looking blue instead of purple. Duration of this stun is now 6 seconds instead of 12.
	-DragonStrike armor against FLAME now 5% from 0%.

	-DragonStrike FireStraffe damage against units reduced. Damage is now concentrated in the area with actual fire FX's. It still has "invisible damage" behind him, but at least your heroe won't be one-hited by "invisible-damage" behind the dragon. This invisible is useful to keep DragonStrike effective against structures in a larger area withou causing the "stuck-at-map-sides-bug"
	-DragonStrike FireStraffe dealing double damage against bases in the sides of the map fixed. Damage is still high because he's doing a 180 turn around above your fortress, which means more time above your fortress. But it is no longer x2 damage, rather x1.35. However, a tooltip has been added to remind players how effective DS is if casted in map sides.
	-DragonStrike FireStraffe damage highly improved against fortress and the structures in the area you cast it. (Players needs to consider where DS will come from and from where will he leave)
