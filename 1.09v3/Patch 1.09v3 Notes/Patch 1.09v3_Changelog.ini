	-Saruman level 10 thunderbolt storm enabled again. Expecting Val gives some love to it.




	-MordorMouthOfSauron EvilEye damage against Drogoth now 140% from 100%. (From causing 10% health bar damage, to 15%)
	-MordorMouthOfSauron EvilEye damage against WitchKingOnFellbeast now 80% from 85%.
	-MordorMouthOfSauron EvilEye damage against Fellbeast now 90% from 85%.
	-MordorMouthOfSauron EvilEye damage against SummonedEagle now 120% from 115%.
	
	
	-GoblinKing model now 10% bigger.
	-Mounted GoblinKing now has its attack-moving animation enabled.
	-Mounted GoblinKing moving animation speeded up 10%. (only the animation not the speed)
	-Mounted GoblinKing locomotor fixed improved.
	-Mounted GoblinKing locomotor SlowTurnRadius now 10 from 0. A 180º turn around from the scorpion no longer needs to rotate on its own vertix (which was no animation and makes no use of the 6 dammit legs at all). A fast U will be walked.
	-Mounted GoblinKing locomotor FastTurnRadius now 28 from 10. (Originally 48, but it freezes and gets stuck on himself). Instead of rotating on its own vertix, now the increased radius allow the scorpion to actually walk in a U.
	-Mounted GoblinKing locomotor Acceleration and Braking time now 1000/800 from 100/100. (A normal horse is 1500/1500). This fixes the freezes when doing any kind of turn; even a small angle turn would cause buggy mini-freezes. 100/100 values are here since 1.06.
	
	 
	
	
	
	-Fixed Drogoth Incinerate damaging behind him, where there's no or any logical fire. Damage now matches the fire in a proper 90º radius + beneath him. And it can still kill flyers.

	Elves
		-fixed elven mallorn beign recognised as a unit productor kind of building. (gob tunel was fixed in v2 already). //Implies scalars from the new 25pp will be more acurate. For example flood in v2 is meant to always destroy farms but not barracks. This KindOf error meant mallorn would get less damage.
		-ElvenRivendellLancer damage gains now between level 2 and level 10 now 5 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 4, from 0 on all levels. (in 1.09v1 was 10 10 10 10 5 5 5 5 5) (Total gains 40 from 0, and 65 in 109v1)

		//////////;;Not really. can't be fixed. Can fix it getting stuck at least.-Fixed DragonStrike causing x2 damage against a base that was built in the sides of the map.
		-DragonStrike speed while firing now 75 from 55. Damage increased proportionally as it means less time scorching the cast area. 
		-DragonStrike straffe area/radius cursor now 290/320 from 500/320 respectively (originally 180/180). Fixes DragonStrike not managing to exit the map when casted in the map sides, getting stuck and damaging permanently beneath him. (Straffe radius now shorter than radius cursor). Damage increased proportionally as it means less time scorching the cast area. 
		-DragonStrike damage against units reduced. Damage is now concentrated in the area with actual fire FX's. It still damages behind him, but at least your heroe won't be one-hited if he was hit by "invisible-damage". This invisible is useful to keep DS effective against structures.
		-DragonStrike dealing double damage against bases in the sides of the map fixed. Damage is still high because he's doing a 180 turn around above your fortress, which means more time above your fortress. But it is no longer x2 damage, rather x1.2
		-DragonStrike damage against fortress will depend of where you cast it.
		-DragonStrike reload time now 695 from 670. (Originally 720, like any other generic 25pp)

		-Mordor FiresOfDoom reload time now 630 seconds from 600. (Originally 720). //Note Sunflare is 600seconds, both powers are similary designed but the different is that FiresOfDoom deals insane damage on structures (depending it is casted). //By design this spell needs a stronger nerf, but the mordor PP path that leads to this is terrible, unlike elfs.
		
		
	Gobs
		-WildMarauder health gains per level improved by 50%. (+195 health points from 130%) Consider base is 600.
