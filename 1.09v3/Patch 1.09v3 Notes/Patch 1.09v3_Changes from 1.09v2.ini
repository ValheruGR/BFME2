	-TierFour: SummonedDragon FireBreath damage taperoff now 50%, from 45%.

	-TierFour: SummonedDragon FireBreath : now 1/3 of it's damage has 45 radius on 180º arc, instead of 140 radius on 125º arc. (This improves the meele behavior, when heroes are stuck beneath the dragon sometimes they would not get any damage at all due the arc)
	-TierFour: Balrog: Sounds:BalrogSummonMusic min volume reduced to 60%, from 100%.
	-TierFour: Balrog whip siege damage now deals 120%, from 200% against MordorWitchKingOnFellbeast.
