It still has "invisible damage" behind him, but at least your heroe won't be one-hited by "invisible-damage" behind the dragon.

	-Beta01: Isengard: SpellBook.DragonStrike: FireStrafe dealing double damage against bases in the sides of the map fixed. Damage is still high because he's doing a 180 turn around above your fortress, which means more time above your fortress. But it is no longer x2 damage, rather x1.35.

	-Beta01: Isengard: SpellBook.DragonStrike: FireStrafe damage highly improved against fortress and the structures in the area you cast it. (Players needs to consider where DS will come from and from where will he leave)
