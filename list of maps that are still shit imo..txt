black gate 2. don't see point keeping very similar maps. ass less maps there, better. I 'D REMOVE.
dreamflower. nobody would 1v1 there, and aesthetically not rlly nice. Unlike argonath II, which it's gameplay is shit but it is beatiful. I 'D REMOVE.
starfall. i still hate ground textures, too noob work. many squares. I 'D REMOVE.
silverlode. gay shape. at least i removed gayposts. I 'D REMOVE.
Baggin's Camping Grounds. i edited it but imo it's still being a shitty map, doesn't look natural. and if t3a fags are getting exquisite... I 'D REMOVE.
golden grove needs beauty edit, less drakes on middle maybe. not sure. it stops players attack certain players. its 7p map.
LOSSARNACH IS RUINED IT'S HORRIBLE NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW :(:((((((
IRON HILLS 3 NEEDS FLATTERN
THARBAD NEEDS TO BE EDITED. HOW TO PUT SPREAD LAIRS?Â¿


i particulary never liked old forest, but that's subjetive. i guess map is ok.
