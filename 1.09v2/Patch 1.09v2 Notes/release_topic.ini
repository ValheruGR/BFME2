[center]Hi All,  Patch 1.09 Version 2.0 is finally here for download. For years later and here we are with another enormous patch filled with goodies, cows, and even a pig for Dwarves.  A huge thanks to everyone involved but particularly Ech my right hand man & Ridder Geel for his work on the launcher.  It is a privileged and a blessing to be able to present to you this gift to the community. We hope that you enjoy it as much as we do, happy new years to everyone! [/center]

A note about version naming - as of this release and in the future, we will be using similar naming conventions to 2.02. 1.09 Version 2.0, 3.0 and so forth. So get used to it :)

[center]The launcher now comes with auto update features, links to Discord/GR/Facebook groups, and the choice of map height between two different zoom levels. Future releases can now be quickly integrated in a manner of minutes and so the days of new launchers holding up releases are gone for good[/center]

[b][size=2]14 Years Of Competitive Balancing[/size][/b]


[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]

BFMEII Patch 1.09 Version 2.0 is one of the largest patches we've ever developed. It was the result of 116 different beta builds over several years. We've taken great care to remedy the last few difficult matchups that existed in 1.09 Version 1.0. It also comes with many other goodies not related to balance.

Yep, an issue that has plagued BFME2 for over a decade is finally gone for good. Also, you no longer require mini images to play without a disc, every version in this launcher is cracked. The only image you will ever require now is to install BFME2

[b][size=2]New Leadership Stacking System[/size][/b]


[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]

In comparison to Version 1.0, 2.0 has added new cast effects for spells such as rallycall, warchant, mighty rage and more. Also, there is now a revamped leadership system which allows certain damage and armor leaderships to stack that previously didn't(and some that are now immune to debuff). One such example would be Theoden and Rallycall(or Boromir), shown below as solo visual, and then stacked visual. This enables more interesting early game mechanics and player choices.You can see in game tooltips for more information and we will likely publish a guide to it in the near future.

[b][size=2] New Buff and Leadership Cast Effects [/size][/b]


[img]https://www.gamereplays.org/community/uploads/post-50947-1489933995.png[/img]


Beautiful remakes of RallyCall, Warchant, and even cast effects for spells which never had any, such as MightyRage. Dwarven RallyCall now shows as gold to differentiate it from Men and Elves, given its different bonus.
