-All-faction Fortress arrows damage against cavalry 135% from 150%. (from 100% for Elf)

;;Explaination;;
;;BT2DC seted up this change: "All fortrees towers damage to be 60 from 75. And deal 150% to cavalry" --this doesn't affect Mordor barricades at all, they work differently and they have not required a change--. They ended up reverting this, but they kept the 150% scalar on cavalry. Not rlly bad, but obviusly it was a lazzy work. This 150% scalar on cavalry affects all Axe Thrown structural weapons, including sentry towers. And since Haradrim palace and Treasure Trove use Fortress weapons, they also had got this homosexual bonus. 
;Note this bt2dc fags did not add this Structural damage buff to elves.
;;Now i made sure only fortress towers and fortress itself have it. I REDUCED the damage on cavalry (Mordor Goblins Isen Men Dwarves), and INCREASED it for elves.
