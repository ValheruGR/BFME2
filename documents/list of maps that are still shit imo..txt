dreamflower. nobody would 1v1 there, and aesthetically not rlly nice. Unlike argonath II, which it's gameplay is shit but it is beatiful. I 'D REMOVE.
starfall. i still hate ground textures, too noob work. many squares. I 'D REMOVE.
silverlode. gay shape. at least i removed gayposts. I 'D REMOVE.
golden grove needs beauty edit, less drakes on middle maybe. not sure. it stops players attack certain players. its 7p map.
