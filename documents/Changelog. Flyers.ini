;;------------------------------------Flyers indirect, direct attack glitches--------------------;;
Indirect attack = Attack dealt by Mordor Flyers and Eagles when they are attacking a different kind of target (Usually Monsters & Structures)
Direct attack = Any Flyer attacking a target on purpose, either automatically or targeted by the player.
One-Hit = Instant kill.
;;Explaination. All flyers EXCEPT Drogoth have 2 main weapons, one that attacks machines and structures called PLOW, and other that attacks infantry and cavalry called GRAB ATTACK(direct attack against BW). Drogoth have one simple weapon that is used against everything. Originally, this PLOW weapon is ALSO activated against BattleWagons when the flyer attacks a Structure or a real siege machine while the battlewagon is inside the damaged area, making any wagon die instantly. 
;Now this PLOW weapon does not insta-kill BattleWagons (Indirect attack), but it deals a damage amount similar to the GRABATTACK weapon in a very small radius. In big radius, damage is lower.
