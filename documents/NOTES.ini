
ECH, ive a feeling I know why we r getin crashes and mostly on FoL.

Need you to do something, make all banners use the same targetname in explevels as their host. So for example, Lorien Archer Banner

GOOD_TROOPS_LORIENARCHER, should also include target name ElvenBanner.

I looked at Vanilla, and also 108, and the vast majority of banner carriers share the same exp required and exp awards as their host. 

Furthermore, in 1.09, FoD mostly use their parent names shared with the banner. Example EVIL_WEAK_MORDOR MordorFighter MordorFighterHorde MordorBannerOrc GoblinFighter_1Exp

Take a look at  TargetNames								= GOOD_TROOPS_LORIENARCHER
    RequiredExperience                    = EXPERIENCE_REQUIRED_GOOD_TROOP_LA_6
    ExperienceAward                        =  EXPERIENCE_AWARD_GOOD_TROOP_6
	
	
	Then refer to ElvenBanner which is under GOOD_TROOPS
	
	Refer to GOOD_TROOPS past level 6, 
	
	 RequiredExperience						=    EXPERIENCE_REQUIRED_GOOD_TROOP_6
    ExperienceAward							=    EXPERIENCE_AWARD_GOOD_TROOP_6
	
It is sharing different exp required then its horde, I think this is causing conflict. 

You will notice in 1.08 that most FoL names are all shared under GOOD_TROOPS

I DONT KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THIS WILL FIX CRASHES, BUT GIVEN THAT EVEN PEOPLE ON DECENT PC's ARE CRASHING ASWELL IT IS WORTH LOOKING AT POSSIBLE CAUSES OTHER THAN GRAPHICS.

PLEASE DO THIS REQUEST, WE NEED TO START TRIAL AND ERROR, CANNOT RELEASE FUKING PATCH IF ITS CRASHING

RequiredExperience    AND      ExperienceAward     OF ALL BANNERS NEEDS TO BE IDENTICAL TO THEIR HOST HORDE

///----------------------------stuff i liked from rotwk---------------------------------------------------//
- Flood horse damage now has a 400% scalar against the Balrog.
;;sounds excelent, water hurting a aflamed unit, would also be pretty good for balance that flood can hurt +35% health bar of balrog
- Uruk Pikemen now have a new attack animation.
;;i haven't sen it, but i would love to see uruk pikemen stop fuckin kicking lol. so big pike they don't even use it, not even against cavalry melee.
