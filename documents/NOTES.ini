
*Questioms
-drogoth still leveling up too fast. on everygame he is made, he always reach to level 10. while wk no. I think it is because drogoth one-hits all kind of cavalry, because of this BT2DC buff. DROGOTH_PLOW_DAMAGE_INNER			675 ; ; 750 ; ; 200" Maybe nerf that?
-dragon strike cooldown buff? its 720 like Rog. should be 600 like sunflare/rainoffire.
-val to make a better fire fx for ignited rog, so one can know when is he ignited and when he isnot.
-drummers to buff other trolls. from popular opinion, nub bfme1 fans.
-galadriel op. no really way to kill her being goblin/mordor. can we nerf hp of ring heros a bit多


**Small selection boxes to fix
-heavy armored lorien units need target box. mirkwoods, legolas.
-battlewagons needs box, fox needs box :D
-mordor and goblin buidlers need target box
-SPIDER FUCKIN RIDERS NEED BOX. MYSELF CAN NOT SELECT THEM WHEN GOBLINS AROUND. even if zoomed in
-easterling bigger box too
-campfire bigger target box
-LEGOLAS NEEDS BIGGER TARGET BOX. not so much tho. probbly thranduil too. compare to faramir?


***BUGS BUGS BUGS and cosmetic issues
-dwarven fortress model, whatever it has of different, fucks animations. the 4 dwarves in top of the fortress do not spawn.
-barracks and fortress showing ultra high texture in low lod.
-haradrims with barbed arrows are glitcheable, you can use barbed arrows on every haradrim archer you have, unranked or not. IF at least ONE is rank 3. Same happpens with Men of Dale Black Arrows, and i still can't fix it. Only for summoned ones.
-mordor walls; the heavy armor green aura is displayed on wall foundations. wallhubs are buildable without fortress. gates built in hubs do not require 3-4 spots like other walls in game. unfinished work.
-isengard building floors are incomplete. level 2 and level 3 indistinguishably. and sometimes they display the old floor, probably when damaged. unfinished work.
-every fuckin unit needs a differentiable housecolors. everyone agrees it ruins the unit skins, but on a multiplayer game units are almost undifferentiable. without mention about trolls, they simply don't recolor. aesthetically nice but gay.
-sometimes killed cavetrolls dont play the death animation and fadeout.
-Grima poison nugget was casted over lurtz. It displayed farsight/mightyrage/palantir ones, couldn't recognise. UA does similar, displaying poison nugget. (somtimes).


Visual stuff:
-Change the floor of pippin camp fire. ATM its same than gorkil..
*make some visual shits over taint land, like a ded dragon,rocks etc.  ---so it can be differenciable of FoD fortress floors. * yeh maybe *
*val needs to do house color for arwen mounted, all other elf heroes are finished


val's own notes
*add ring hero spells to AI
*apparently War of the Ring AI is broken
-MITHLONDS ARE HARDLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM LORIEN MASSES
-guerrilla said devastation affects dragon strike?多?多?多 test
-saruman level 10 is shit :P not even badass 
if fellbeasts get raped by ithilien rangers, why keep faramir good against fb?



TEST;
-Fixed dragon strike getting blocked and stuck till the object who blocks him dies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;LIE. NEED TO TEST MORE.
-phalanex and guardians attacking inside a taken down mine shaft. is it fix? -Test with randy guardians and phalanxing attacking inside a mine deleted.

STUFF THAT IS NOT COMPLETLY REVISED or doesn't look atractive for release version.;
-aragorn oathbreakers, are they good enough for release version?
-mirkwoods at 15 still dont convince me. makes them tough against FoL factions and FoD don't rlly give a fuck.
-gandalf revive timers, word of power relations.
  
  
STUFF I CAN NOT FIX;
-STILL CAN'T GET EAGLE TO AWARD EXPERIENCE. IF I CAN'T DO THAT, DOUBT I WILL BE ABLE TO DO ON SUMMONEDS.
VAL TO TYPE ON LOG WHAT THE FUCK DOES ELROND RESTORE DO? AND EDIT STRING CONTROLBAR:ToolTipElrondRestoration
-thranduil invisible when mounted. STILL CANT FIX
-still can't fix black arrows on non-summoned. neither haradrim new barbed arrows.
-axe throwers still attacking outside his visual area untill the object they were aiming dies.
-i can not fix SignalFire reducing the pp timers while it is destroyed
-spider rider banner carrier self displaying always poison, even if i gave them a weapon to not to. Only visual.


STUFF TO STILL DO/CHECK 
-files to finish, and check 	dwarfcastlewalls.ini, MaxBuildoutDistance,
