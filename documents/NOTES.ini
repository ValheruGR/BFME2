SarumonDominateDotsVals if it still lagging make it low or above- errr no, that means anyone on low detail will also render it...



-Shelob needs to take more experience required for level 9 and 10. and one of their spells must go to a lower level. Two powers at level 10 at once looks noob. Perhaps teleport to 7/9 and webbing to level 10, but with a lot more exp required and diferent weapons. I think a long ranged web doesn't fit with drain life. If it was different animation, and meele style. (like nazgul cripple sword) yes.



//-------------------------Cosmetics: disaproved populary, errors or just bad-------------//
-ArCh4Ng3L: not to mention i dispise the new bubble icon
-can mirkwoods go back to 10 or 12 units? i can buff them thru different ways. (besides, they are replenish faster if small horde :) )
-Mirkwood 15units horde is annoying.
-HOUSE COLORS!!!  arwen. drogoths. - dworf heroes getting house colors in HD pack, drogoth ill do one for. Arwens model isnt staying.
-some bw have wrong spawn model and wrong death model. You kill a goat but you see a rino die.
*Ent moot damaged model looks terrible, it's not a model, but bfme2 turns your model into a 140p resolution shit. Besides the normal tree looks already un-natural
-isengard building floors are incomplete. level 2 and level 3 indistinguishably. and sometimes they display the old floor, probably when damaged. unfinished work imo.
//-------------------------LIL DISPUTES---------------------------//

-Trolls with tree using shoulder weapon on structures. Otto says it's bad because goblin/dwarves can leave units of the mine then. I say it's Excelent.
//---------------------------IDEAS---------------------------------//
CAN WE CONTACT ROTWK BOYS TO GIVE US THEIR MUSIC? 1.09 SHOULD HAVE HOBBIT MUSICS
otto idea-Make barricade be affectable by morgul armor, green shit + armor buff + hp nerf.
ecth idea-Make all taint land/wood radius smaller EXCEPT THE elf one???

///-------------------------------------BUGS or important errors--------------------------------//
-devastation some times causes crash  -  i will check the model
-Grond not attacking fortress with moat still can't be fixed.

-BT2DC, WITH THE INTENTION OF BUFF HARADRIM ARCHERS AGAINST PIERCE, ENDED UP BUFFING GONDOR ARCHERS, ORC ARCHERS, AND DALE ARCHERS.
Dale archer buff is good----->Everyone happy and even it's not enough.
GONDOR archer buff is bad -----> broke men vs goblins mu in a worse away. --->reason of Val's 1.07 HP nerf. 
Mordor archer buff is bad -----> reason of mordor archers with horde bonus and taint land raping Lorien archers, whose never got pierce buff.----> here a -10% nerf. Average of bt2dc and 1.06 is always good.




-Revise Flood healing Ents. what happened with it after all?
-make harad and hobbits hit flyers. 

;;=Its not happening now=;;-Removed marauder aditional +50% damage against cavalry. 
(Why ONLY marauders get this +50% buff, while the other pikes on the game not? Give it to phalanx and you will see how OP)
;;=Its not happening now=;;-Fixed marauder gaining double damage against cavalry.
;;=Its not happening now=;;--Marauder now deals FULL splash damage against cavalry. From 100 dmg on 0 radius, and 50 damage on 7.5 radius. 
(this means 100 splash damage, from 150 damage (third part of this damage was splash)
;;=Its not happening now=;;--Marauder pike radius now 6 from 7.5.

;;explaination, at the begining, that was an excelent BT2DC change. But what happens if anyone casts warchant/darkness or just levels up the marauders, for example to rank 5? They end up with 120 damage by one side, and 70 damage by the other side, against cavalry. That's 190 damage, more than enough to one-hit most of the cavalry units. 

;;--------------------darkness shit---------------
-THE problem is the cloudbreak module, it's constantly respawns the sunbeam object where PLAYER CAMERA is. so if you stand in a place, wait a while. you will have 50000000000 sunbeam objects in screen. That's why cloudbreak duration is 5 seconds.
Duration MUST be the same as weather duration. (3 minutes)
