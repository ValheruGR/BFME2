Interesting, scavenger give more money per hero rank. If treebeard was level 1, the money he would give is 375. But since he's level 10, he gives 750.

VAL TO TYPE ON LOG WHAT THE FUCK DOES ELROND RESTORE DO? AND EDIT STRING CONTROLBAR:ToolTipElrondRestoration
-VAL TO FIX TEXTURE LOD ON DWARF BARRACK AND FORTRESS,. and who knows what else... all faction barracks apparently.


Reports to Val:

-treebeard autoheal shows his own leadership nugget. (somtimes)
-Grima poison nugget was casted over lurtz. It displayed farsight/mightyrage/palantir ones, couldn't recognise. UA does similar, displaying poison nugget. (somtimes)
-Change the floor of pippin camp fire. ATM its same than gorkil..
-willow needs houseofcolor
*make some visual shits over taint land, like a ded dragon,rocks etc.  ---so it can be differenciable of FoD fortress floors. * yeh maybe *


val's own notes
*add ring hero spells to AI
*add TB spell to AI
*apparently War of the Ring AI is broken
