Reports to Val:
-CaveTrolls without tree gaining maze at level 5.
-CaveTrolls their death animation is fucked. They fade out...
-Grima poison nugget was casted over lurtz. It displayed farsight/mightyrage/palantir ones, couldn't recognise. 
-Restore saruamn level 10 soon please, and add the stormy FX i pretended.Â¿
-Otto and i are wondering why can't bfme2 structures be built closer to the other, like on RotWK. On bfme2 you can actually do it, only if both base foundations are casted together before both builders arrive. Exeptions of structures being able to be built almost inside others are mordor taverns. 
-It's fuckin impossible to stop Thranduil invisibility when he is mounted. No conditions for this.



-Change the floor of pippin camp fire. ATM its same than gorkil.
-serker after level 5 be blue sword (only for ultra lod, that would be interesting and surprising)
-willow needs houseofcolor
-THERE'S SOME NEW FIRE ARROWS ICON THAT LOOKS BAD FOR EVIL FACTIONS. I WOULD LIKE TO DECIDE WHERE TO PUT EACH ONE.
