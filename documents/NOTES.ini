Child objects of child objects/object with build variations do not work properly. ATM it's temporally fixed for 1v1, but childs are having problems with campaign and references on awardsystem (cah trophies i guess)





//-------------------------Cosmetics: disaproved populary, errors or just bad-------------//
-UNITS UNDER NUGGETS EFFECTS SOMETIMES SHOW WRONG NUGGET. I figured out when it happens... it happens only on certain asset.dat. I thin assetcachebuilder is not very confident program?
-notes about saruman level 10, it's ranged. THE FX comes from saruman, not in the casted area. So you have all FX coming from saruman and a circle of "invisible damage" feets away from him. We can say that only the 50% of the FX fits with the damage. (reason of why i made it one-click)
And i still think that damage from each single thunderbolt fx is way cool'er.
ERROR ERROR. MOUNTAIN TROLLS HAVE FUCKED THEIR STONED MODEL !!
-ArCh4Ng3L: not to mention i dispise the new bubble icon
-can mirkwoods go back to 10 or 12 units? i can buff them thru different ways. (besides, they are replenish faster if small horde :) )
-Mirkwood 15units horde is annoying.
-some bw have wrong spawn model and wrong death model. You kill a goat but you see a rino die.
*Ent moot damaged model looks terrible, it's not a model, but bfme2 turns your model into a 140p resolution shit. Besides the normal tree looks already un-natural
-isengard building floors are incomplete. level 2 and level 3 indistinguishably. and sometimes they display the old floor, probably when damaged. unfinished work imo.
//-------------------------LIL DISPUTES---------------------------//
-Freedoom to walls spam: It's cool that you can build walls in the fords of a river and force a siege battle. BUT IT IS NOT COOL WHEN WALLS ARE MADE TO SURROUND ENEMY FORTRESS AND SPAM CATAPULTS. 
-Trolls with tree using shoulder weapon on structures: Otto says it's bad because goblin/dwarves can leave units of the mine then. I say it's Excelent.
//---------------------------IDEAS---------------------------------//
otto idea-Make barricade be affectable by morgul armor, green shit + armor buff + hp nerf.
otto idea-Shelob should not have two level 10 spells at once.One of them must go to a lower level. Perhaps teleport to 7/9 and webbing to level 10, but with a lot more exp required and stronger weapon.
ecth idea. eowyn shit. (i did a post on staff beta thread. I need the Go.
ecth idea-Shelob webbing diferent weapons. I think a long ranged web doesn't fit with drain life. If it was different animation, and meele style. (like nazgul cripple sword) yes. Otherway make it do something that is not damage and drain. And make it useless against Sam. 
///-------------------------------------BUGS or important errors--------------------------------//
-devastation some times causes crash  -  i will check the model
-random crashes with random players. no patterns found but i blame assetcachebuilder.
-Grond not attacking fortress with moat still can't be fixed. 
-spining trolls granting PP. and sometimes 100pp per second
;----bugs awareness. we can't fix-
-spellstore unavailable (occurs less often with fps restored)
-redbug
-oos

;;----------------------------ecthelion shit------------------------------;;

curiosity: haradrim archers have same HP and DMG as ithilien ranger, and the only armorset differences is haradrims take 300 crush and rangers 450 crush. but haradrims take 100% pierce and rangers 70%

PENALTY damage type. When units are flanking i think they deal this damage type. that's why pikes can die from it.


The changes in comparison with original would be: basic meele damage became slow, with 1/4 more damage, area damage and a bunch of unnecesary scalars based on the double nugget error. Cost 1800 from 1500 and automatic crush desaceleration reduction bonus for rohirrims on level 7 for rohirrims. Maiden and disguise swaped. Spear gained radius dmg but double cooldown and uselessness vs mordor flyers. Also, spear became hero dmg with 50% bonus on evil heros. Maiden armor bonus nerfed a lot but added speed bonus... she sucks.


if farm takes less cavalry, means good vs elf and isen.  mirror dont care.
if SH takes more cavalry, means good vs elf, good vs isengard. Bad vs knights/rohirrim. Bad vs BW.

lancer and warg deal too few dmg on slauher house
but they deal too much dmg on farms

-for what i see, mordor slaugher houses deserve it's own armorset, which takes more cavalry damage (just like farm and mallorn do)
-BT2DC, WITH THE INTENTION OF BUFF HARADRIM ARCHERS AGAINST PIERCE, ENDED UP BUFFING GONDOR ARCHERS, ORC ARCHERS, AND DALE ARCHERS.
Dale archer buff is good----->Everyone happy and even it's not enough.
GONDOR archer buff is bad -----> broke men vs goblins mu in a worse away. --->reason of Val's 1.07 HP nerf. 
Mordor archer buff is bad -----> reason of mordor archers with horde bonus and taint land raping Lorien archers, whose never got pierce buff.----> here a -10% nerf. Average of bt2dc and 1.06 is always good.




;;=Its not happening now=;;-Removed marauder aditional +50% damage against cavalry. 
(Why ONLY marauders get this +50% buff, while the other pikes on the game not? Give it to phalanx and you will see how OP)
;;=Its not happening now=;;-Fixed marauder gaining double damage against cavalry.
;;=Its not happening now=;;--Marauder now deals FULL splash damage against cavalry. From 100 dmg on 0 radius, and 50 damage on 7.5 radius. 
(this means 100 splash damage, from 150 damage (third part of this damage was splash)
;;=Its not happening now=;;--Marauder pike radius now 6 from 7.5.

;;explaination, at the begining, that was an excelent BT2DC change. But what happens if anyone casts warchant/darkness or just levels up the marauders, for example to rank 5? They end up with 120 damage by one side, and 70 damage by the other side, against cavalry. That's 190 damage, more than enough to one-hit most of the cavalry units. 

;;--------------------darkness shit---------------
-THE problem is the cloudbreak module, it's constantly respawns the sunbeam object where PLAYER CAMERA is. so if you stand in a place, wait a while. you will have 50000000000 sunbeam objects in screen. That's why cloudbreak duration is 5 seconds.
Duration MUST be the same as weather duration. (3 minutes)
