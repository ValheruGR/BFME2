///----------------------------esthetical requests--------------------------------//
-loading screen/splash screen on spanish for me.
-a refreshed minimap of TOURNAMENT_BT2DC and WESTOLF III. i got no photoshop.
-battlwagon model; COW. 
-isengard building floors are incomplete. level 2 and level 3 indistinguishably. and sometimes they display the old floor, probably when damaged. unfinished work.
*make some visual shits over taint land, like a ded dragon,rocks etc.  ---so it can be differenciable of FoD fortress floors. * yeh maybe *
-new hero portraits to have the blue-retexture when reviving




fellbeast does not have FX OR SOUND AGAINST BATTLEWAGON

///----------------------------Small selection boxes to fix--------------------------------//
-heavy armored lorien units need target box. mirkwoods, legolas.
-mordor and buidlers need target box
-SPIDER FUCKIN RIDERS NEED BOX. MYSELF CAN NOT SELECT THEM WHEN GOBLINS AROUND. even if zoomed in
-easterling bigger box too
-campfire bigger target box
-LEGOLAS NEEDS BIGGER TARGET BOX. not so much tho. probbly thranduil too. compare to faramir?
///----------------------------MAPS THAT ARE SHIT--------------------------------//
1.09 ugly maps;
-starfall. i still hate ground textures, too noob work. many squares. I 'D REMOVE.
-silverlode. gay shape. i had removed outposts but still 'd remove.
-golden grove needs beauty edit, less drakes on middle maybe. not sure. it stops players attack certain players. its 7p map.
-IRON HILLS 3 and lond daer enedh NEEDS FLATTERN
-some valheru maps are too unnatural and gay. like gondor docks/belfalas. whatever that map is.
