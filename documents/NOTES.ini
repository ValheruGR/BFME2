-VAL TO FIX TEXTURE LOD ON DWARF BARRACK AND FORTRESS. and who knows what else...


Reports to Val:
-CaveTrolls their death animation is still fucked. They fade out...
-treebeard autoheal shows his own leadership nugget.
-Grima poison nugget was casted over lurtz. It displayed farsight/mightyrage/palantir ones, couldn't recognise. UA does similar, displaying poison nugget.
-Otto and i are wondering why can't bfme2 structures be built closer to the other, like on RotWK. On bfme2 you can actually do it, only if both base foundations are casted together before both builders arrive. Exeptions of structures being able to be built almost inside others are mordor taverns. 
-Change the floor of pippin camp fire. ATM its same than gorkil..
-willow needs houseofcolor
*make some visual shits over taint land, like a ded dragon,rocks etc.  ---so it can be differenciable of FoD fortress floors. * yeh maybe *


val's own notes
*add ring hero spells to AI
*add TB spell to AI
*all leadership radius needs to go 275 from 200, elrond exception. [c]
*apparently War of the Ring AI is broken
*Isengard map wrong map cache.
*chek mrodor walls geometry
*val needs to do house color for arwen mounted, all other elf heroes are finished
*Ech fortress expansion balance/stats
*val walls


-LEGOLAS NEEDS BIGGER TARGET BOX. not so much tho. probbly thranduil too. compare to faramir?
-MITHLONDS ARE HARDLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM LORIEN MASSES
-isengard building floors are incomplete. level 2 and level 3 indistinguishably. i 'd restore them tbh. originals still look good on black floor
-guerrilla said devastation affects dragon strike?¿?¿?¿ test
-saruman level 10 is shit :P not even badass 
if fellbeasts get raped by ithilien rangers, why keep faramir good against fb?
