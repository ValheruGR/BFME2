-flat iron hilsl 3
-val to do low detail WOP - actually theres nothing in here that should cause lag, fukall burst counts, no models. LightInitialVortexSauronGand is the only entry with a high burst count which is already set to high_or_above. If your shitty PC cant handle high detail FX then simply lower ur settings so that this isnt rendered.
-val to do sauron bubble


///----------------------------ecths TO DO LIST shit-------------------------------------------//

-test cave trolls on sunflare/cloudbrek
-Find a way to make ents aflamed animation not affect them while alived, only run as a death animation. (like Mumakils)
--Do this later, rotwk boys did not fix shit. it's other kindof, not ARMYSUMARY
All siege (such as catapults, rams, Battlewagons, Trolls, Mountain Giants, Ents, Treebeard, Mumakil, as well as Sauron) will no longer cause allied troops to move out of the way when ordered to move in or infront of them. 
-test saruman fireball vs fellbeast. too much buff?

*Difference Elf wood from Men Wood. THE OCL's can be separated with
	ForbiddenUpgradeNames = men faction
	RequiredUpgradeNames = Elf_faction
	Here possibles trees for men faction that appaers in typical ithilien woods;
thoughts;
men wood having different tree or trees. 

elf wood maybe a different taint color? different spawn sound?
