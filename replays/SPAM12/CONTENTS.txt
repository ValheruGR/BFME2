-SHARKU level 8. op?
-ISEN GOBLINS. otto trying to abuse like 1.08, but between the placebo effects of 1.09, otto stubborness while rusty and otto not making marauder trolls. isengard seemed OP and goblins noob.
-RAIN NEVER STOPS RAINING. (NOTE, WE PLAYED WITH WRONG ASSET... PINK BOXES ALL OVER THE MAP. CURIOS THING ABOUT BFME2 RAIN, IT IS SPAWNED ON THE SCREEN OF THE PLAYER. NOT ON EVERY MAP. NOTICEABLE WHEN PINK)
-MORDOR MEN BALANCE. FARAMIR/ARAGORN SCALARS VERY GOOD, BUT MORE MIGHT BE REQUIRED.
-MORDOR ORCS WEAKER TO ARROWS BUT STILL BEING ANNOYING TO MEN DEFENCE. GOOD.
-MOUNTAIN TROLLS IN A CW GAME, BEING USEFUL!!!! AND A BIT OP. (too resistants to hero, and they can't knoback be knobacked and escape easily. not cool)
-elves vs dwarves. legolas nerfs are good, bw on defensive stance survive, good.. lancers are good. axe throwers nerfed, good.
-mos evil eye scalar on WK is good. defensive stance makes huge difference, good.
-dwarves vs isengard. guardians hurt more uruks, good. i still made BW to ensure win. phalanx taking more uruk dmg good, they could even take more.
-dwarves mordor. orcs and archer hurting guardian more. guardian should deal even more dmg to orcs.
