-Fortress structural damage against cave trolls now 200% from 100%. (Consider that originall they used to take 50%.)
-Fortress Tower Expansion(exept Mordor barricade) Damage against cavalry 135% from 150%.
;;Explaination;;
;;BT2DC seted up this change: "All fortrees towers damage to be 60 from 75. And deal 150% to cavalry" --this doesn't affect Mordor barricades at all, they work differently and they have not required a change--. They ended up reverting this, but they kept the 150% scalar on cavalry. Not rlly bad, but obviusly it was a lazzy work. This 150% scalar on cavalry affects all Axe Thrown structural weapons, including sentry towers. And since Haradrim palace and Treasure Trove use Fortress weapons, they also had got this game breaking bonus. 
;Note this bt2dc fags did not add this Structural damage buff to elves.
;;Now has been made sure that only fortress towers and fortress self have it. Damage against cavalry is REDUCED for Goblins Isen Men Dwarves and INCREASED it for elves.
