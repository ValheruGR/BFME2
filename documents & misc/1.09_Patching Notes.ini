		-dismounted eowyn skin.
		-arwen leadership icon please?
		-saruman unpacking Lvl10 needs better fx.
		-FX_SarumanFireBallExplode needs to be improved. some little shake screen and a proper explosion FX.
		-elf warrior select box fucked.
		-need low poligon models for low lod....
		-HOBBIT MUSIC FOR ROYAL GUARD summoning?
		-MODELS:-elf porter boots looking different than vanilla. probbly a house color bug, you said you would check
		-MODELS:Isengard & mORDOR Batterring ram have a broken uruk. One of the 6 units is paralyzed. It's a asset.dat issue. Happens in v2 and v3. But not in v1.
		-MODELS: dain pig house color?
		-val to re add low lod models and keep 128x128 textures available with a L.( i think they get read in the respective L M models)
	-2020 requests.
		-TEXTURES: -Shelob webbing needs a RadiusCursorType
		-DESIGN: -We could put ShieldBubble description/hotkey on palantir so we can bring gandy stancves back.
		-BOXES: -mordor catapult select box too big
		-MODELS: -dwarf rax no longer has a low level of detail model?
		-MODELS: -Wagon goat needs a DUBtlWagon_DIEA

		-FXS: -Drogoth spawn, -lags even on high end computers. duration too long.
		-FXS: -Horde Respawn needs to be differenced from Fortress/Well respawn again. Perhaps a rainbow is not a big deal considering it's 2 colors per faction.
		-ICONS: -can't u re add t3a's dwarf leadership icon? Which by the way, the white background was beautiful unlike the new red icons.
		-ICONS: -gimli slayer icon bad because top left quarter is blue so you can't see reload easily. The same applies to a lot of icons blueis.
		-ICONS: -Grima convert hero icon still gay. Bring back sick theoden bra.
		-ICONS: -Shelob tunnel too similar to shelob webbing.
