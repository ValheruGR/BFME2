wk dismount reloadtime needs to be syncronized.









Anyways, it's the map Gap of Rohan that is having a real-time battle crash. My create a hero is not in that territory. He is way up east and has been fighting in real-time battles no problem, no crashes. I highly recommend investigating the gap of rohan territory in war of the ring, it could be bugged in version 3.

	-About archer hordes. for cowmap
		*btw, did u noticed archers hordes (except lorien) usually have a smoother turning movement behavior than other infantry horde ?
		*they turn correctly to face the direction u click, when other horde sometime move "diagonally" if u see what i mean
		*the differene is caused by the presence of TurnWhileMoving = no on NormalMeleeHordeLocomotor and NormalChargeMeleeHordeLocomotor
		*but not on NormalRangedHordeLocomotor and the TestWallScalingHordeLocomotor
		*this line was added in bfme2
		*i pesonally much prefer units movement with it turned to off
		but it's interesting to compare both

		-DESIGN: -We could put ShieldBubble description/hotkey on palantir so we can bring gandy stancves back.
		-BOXES: -mordor catapult select box too big
		-MODELS: -dwarf rax no longer has a low level of detail model?
		-MODELS: -Wagon goat needs a DUBtlWagon_DIEA
		-FXS: -Sunflare. Doesn't indicate where is damage.-No fx on terrain.-no indicator of where is the center.-It used to have a beautiful w3d model indicating wheres the center now u see ugly floating ball.	-floating ball sucks.
		-FXS: -Drogoth spawn, -lags even on high end computers. duration too long.
		-FXS: -Horde Respawn needs to be differenced from Fortress/Well respawn again. Perhaps a rainbow is not a big deal considering it's 2 colors per faction.
		-ICONS: -can't u re add t3a's dwarf leadership icon? Which by the way, the white background was beautiful unlike the new red icons.
		-ICONS: -gimli slayer icon bad because top left quarter is blue so you can't see reload easily. The same applies to a lot of icons blueis.
		-ICONS: -Grima convert hero icon still gay. Bring back sick theoden bra.
		-ICONS: -Shelob tunnel too similar to shelob webbing.
