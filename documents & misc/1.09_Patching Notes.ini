Mordor need spire cuz they cant stand toe toe with other factions armies. "

			-Effect of high ranked units.
				
		1.09 v3 Summary of significant changes.
			1-Horde vs horde pathfinding improved. hordes don't get stuck while walking and surround enemies without taking retarded directions.
			2-Banners and upgrades costing different per unit. (like 2.02 did but it is not tiered and icons can be multi-executed in one command)
			3-Reworked the way damage/health is gained to slow down the snowball effect of a level4-5 unit in a early game. (1.09 dmg/health gains are high in the first 5 levels then they are minor)
			4-Gandy, Wk, Rohirrim nerfs
			5-Mallorn lvl2 armor	(MineShaft and Farm already do this since 1.09v2)
			6-Berserker halftroll and spiderider dmg/health gains are now more significant. 
			7-Berserker autoheal at 3 from 5.
			8-EvilFortress can now heal monsters but it is extremely slow. Now u can save ur 0.001 hp troll.
			9-Spiderling can now chase anything including orcs or corsairs.
			10-Spiderider, GorkilScorpion and Shelob now have an improved locomotor (Shelob locomotor stolen from 2.02)
			11-Arwen flood changes at level 4, 7, 10, casting more flood horses.
			12-Tier4 powerpoints more significant, enough to make a fortress look damaged. (EQ, Flood, DS, etc)
			13-Wyrm controllable but reloads slow
			14-Mordor ugly meteorite spell now consist on 3 meteorites fired for during a second and occupy bigger radius
			15-BattleWagon, Cavetroll and Attacktroll can now purchase heavy armor.
			16-Gimli leap now has ultra concentrated high dmg in its epicenter to one hit 4-5 units every time.
			17-MightyCatapult from citadel now 5 rocks from 4.
			18-Sharku new lvl10 ability summon 3 wargs hordes of 5 with armor
			19-Saruman blast now have ultra concentrated high dmg in a tiny and close-to-saru radius to onehit (same concept than gimli leap)
			20-DragonStrike now comes faster and improved vs bases aswell, but reloads slower like any other 25pp.
			21-Every siege attack have splash damage against wall (baterring rams, trolls bash, ents punchs, grond, etc)
			22-Mumakil doesnt deal splash dmg vs units if attacking a building unless u right-click a unit (meant for dwarves to evacuate while a muma is attacking)
			23-Fellbeast becomes stronger in level 6, matching a texture change that makes him black.
			24-Saruman new lvl10 ability (badass like 1.09v2 one but being ranged with concentrated high damage)
			25-Unused fortress upgrades being cheaper like floodgatesa and minelauncher.
			26-Sounds like hobbit or ent summon are now considered as music to avoid copyright shit in youtube if you play without game music
			27-Every unit displays damage in portrait and it also representates the effect of leadership but also forgedblades.
			28-Mounted banner carriers now properly behave like a cavalry unit, crushing decelerating and everything
			29-Leadership tooltips ultra simplified
			30-Heroes that give 50% dmg now give 35% or 40%, so using RallyingCall above these heroes is not entirely useless.

 	-MODELS:-elf porter boots looking different than vanilla. probbly a house color bug, you said you would check
	-MODELS:Isengard & mORDOR Batterring ram have a broken uruk. One of the 6 units is paralyzed. It's a asset.dat issue. Happens in v2 and v3. But not in v1.
	-MODELS: dain pig house color?




 


	-val to re add low lod models and keep 128x128 textures available with a L.( i think they get read in the respective L M models)
	-Val to don't be a fag and keep my saruman lvl10. Just add part of 09v1 fx during unpack and everyone happy.

	-de_barrage for mithril needs to stop showing red lava. aint there blue lava texture?

palantira for ffx






	;;--------
	-TEXTURES:-Shelob webbing needs a RadiusCursorType
	-TEXTURES: -load_w_ea.jpg must not have hole inside.
 	-TEXTURES.-TowerGuard heavy armor barely noticeable.
 	;;--------
	-DESIGN:-We could put ShieldBubble description/hotkey on palantir so we can bring gandy stancves back.
	;;-----------------
	-BOXES: -wagon goat is harder to click. There's no select box in the cart, only in the animal. pretty hard to target on movement. 
   	-BOXES: mordor catapult select box too big
   	;;--------
	-MODELS:-dwarf rax no longer has a low level of detail model?
	-MODELS:-delete the ent that looks like treebeard?
	-MODELS:-Wagon goat needs a DUBtlWagon_DIEA
 	;;--------
 	-FXS: Sunflare.
		-Doesn't indicate where is damage.-No fx on terrain.-no indicator of where is the center.-It used to have a beautiful w3d model indicating wheres the center now u see ugly floating ball.	-floating ball sucks.
	-FXS: Drogoth spawn, -lags even on high end computers. duration too long.
 	-FXS: Horde Respawn needs to be differenced from Fortress/Well respawn again. Perhaps a rainbow is not a big deal considering it's 2 colors per faction.
  	;;--------
 	-SOUNDS: dale summon sound for dale instead of dunedains summon fx.
	;;--------
	-ICONS:-Dwarf rebuild too similar to dwarf rallyingcall. CAN YOU MAKE REBUILD BLUEISH?
	-ICONS: dissent icon to be green
 	-ICONS: -can't u re add t3a's dwarf leadership icon? Which by the way, the white background was beautiful unlike the new red icons.
	-ICONS: -gimli slayer icon bad because top left quarter is blue so you can't see reload easily. The same applies to a lot of icons blueis.
	-ICONS: -Grima convert hero icon still gay. Bring back sick theoden bra.
	-ICONS:-Shelob tunnel too similar to shelob webbing.

;;I kept method 2 but reduced experience multiplier. U gonna have OP unit but you will have to pay for it.
