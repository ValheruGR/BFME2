And deal 150% to cavalry" --this doesn't affect Mordor barricades at all, they work differently and they have not required a change--. They ended up reverting this, but they kept the 150% scalar on cavalry. Not rlly bad, but obviusly it was a lazzy work. This 150% scalar on cavalry affects all Axe Thrown structural weapons, including sentry towers. And since Haradrim palace and Treasure Trove use Fortress weapons, they also had got this game breaking bonus. //LogNote:;Note this bt2dc guys did not add this Structural damage buff to elves.//Now has been made sure that only fortress towers and fortress self have it.
