					;;to fix Changelogs unreadable in text
	-show all caracthers, search \n replace with \r\n. (extended mode)
					;;tower expansions armorset;;
	-Pierce damage looks fine, but something that fuckin irritates me is how pikes take it down easily, but swords no. Can we decrease sword armor and strengh vs pike?
	-FortressExpansionArmor needs revision: pikes rape it but swords no.
					;;Mordor archer;;
	-FIX orc archer cp. Either make it 40, or make it 60. But not "60 to purchase" "40 to ocupy"
	-Orc archer spam on horde bonus is too fast.
	-Orc archer have a crush revenge weapon with specialist damage too strong, fine deal if they were slow. But escape from cavalry in fast horde bonus and also hurt them is not cool.
					;;Gob archers;;
	-Same, gob archer spam is uncrusheable if bats or land are casted before getting crushed. Revert my crush buff of 1.09. Damage is fine. And maybe even consider reducing their poisonous crush revenge weapon....
					;;Crossbow;; 
	-Excelent vs Gobs/mordor, very bad vs FoL and even isen. (isen mirrors are trully boring)
	-crossbows still too good vs FoL but bad vs gobs. Maybe that's cuz Bats dependence...
					;;Gondor Soldier;;
	-men soldier is too weak to pikes.
	-Idea, make shieldwalls stronger than uruk. Like beating them in 1v1. Needs strengh vs arrows and cavalry aswell. Or, just fix the one-hit crush from cavalry. (i know how now)
					;;Uruk hais;;
	-They seriuosly need to lose the 1v1 against guardian.
					;;Leadership system;;
	-idea: make all 50% armor leaderships to 33%.
	what if 50% of all leaderships becomes uncancelable. and 50% gets debuffed. Divide all leaderships into spelly leadership.
	-y si hacemos que el bats o crebain directamente no remueva el rally call?
					;;Banners
	-barrage needs to dont rape banners too. Always whipe whole elf armies, since mithlonds don't survive siege damage as other pikes do.
					;;cloudbreak
	-Can we make it affect mumakils?
					;,watcher
	-can we make watcher don't fuckin knockback strong heros? or at least make it also affect self player.
					;;walls
	-increase experience awards from walls.
					;;lorien warriors.
	-lorien warrior heavy armor needs nerf actually, only noormal armor was the problem.
					;;trolls
	-Mt needs to take more cavalry or sword dmg. and dont fuckin heal so fast
	-increase exp required for mountain troll. make same as AT. They level up destroying farms, thus, faster than attack trolls.
	-troll cage too strong, can we make it strong on level 3 but not level 1? There's no punishment for starting 4 SH 1 trollcage.
					;;revise the CP of all INN units.
	-Peasants ocupy 10 cp, and they are pretty good at taking down fortresses....
					;;treebeard
	-treebeard too strong. Not even fire kills the fucker, and he's too fast. Like giants.
	-treebeard dont get dmg by devastation..cambiar el marketplace 25% por 33% en español
	-treebeard survives fire and heals....
					;;elrond
	-this motherfucker level 5 tornado....
	-elrond tornado to suck them but fart them to home is possible? still op for level 5 anyways.
					;;catapults
	-SiegeEngineArmor. their armorset needs to take more siege damage. trolls still dont kill catas nor artillery works to kill artillery.
	-balista might need a dmg penalty on fort, for it's 100% acuracy it has same dmg as a giant, which now is actually penaltied lel.
	-should be.All artillery machines and Mountain Giants now have +30% range of shroud reveal. ;;/ Not ents due treebeard leadership. (from +17%)
					;;easterlings guys
	RhunHeavyArmor less pierce to take.
	easterlings should be stronger vs magic? they can't survive any kind of blast? nor even saurons.
					;;mountain giants
	-still too op, thousands better (and faster) investment than 3 mordor catapults together.
	-also; Mountain Giant Health 2800 from 4000 was a fake log change.
					;;goblin structures
	-level 3 caves seem almost indestructible by some reason. Can we reduce the HP gains for level 2/level 3 but keeping it strong on level 1?
	-remove all armor bonuses from gob buildings and replace by real Hp. so players can know the truth behinds this OP faction.
					;;ithilien rangers
	-revise gondor rangers - arrow volley bug
	-make ithilein rangers stronger to hero ranged
				;;more
	-galadriel from campaign needs own commandset. Only Ring_HeRo must have AI
	-ai for ring heross

Valheru: u know, this whole crush discovery means ur guna have to eat shit and restore black rider crush adds
Aulë|Ecthelion: i had tested that
Aulë|Ecthelion: and it worked as intended
Aulë|Ecthelion: atm i think AcceptDmgAdd thing only applies for leveling up
Valheru: but, u did it under the assumption that other cav dont get more crush from LD
Aulë|Ecthelion: we forgot to test ranked wargs yesterday
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea that was the paradigma
Valheru: in those 2v2s we played

-Standarize leaderships? Make armor 33 or 33 or 37.5%?

Aulë|Ecthelion: btw
Aulë|Ecthelion: i saw you made another 50% damage leadership bifurcation
Aulë|Ecthelion: for theoden i think
Aulë|Ecthelion: what's the idea behind this bad looking design of stronk theoden with super nerfed gloriuos charge?
Valheru: using words like super for 10% is faggot talk
Valheru: erly game support hero, useless weapon, big suport
Aulë|Ecthelion: but i hate the idea of making leadership complex
Aulë|Ecthelion: for example sibel is making now a video of leadership based with the exact 1.09 leadership sys
Valheru: well, drummer trols is one example
Aulë|Ecthelion: and you add more variations for a 10%
Aulë|Ecthelion: yeah, drummers bad too
Valheru: whos sibel?
Valheru: btw luigi is raging cunt
Aulë|Ecthelion: deathg0d
Aulë|Ecthelion: ah, btw
Aulë|Ecthelion: did you know
Aulë|Ecthelion: sharku saruman and darkness stack?
Aulë|Ecthelion: :D
Valheru: not for long!
Aulë|Ecthelion: 2 years ago i thought only darkness would remain
Aulë|Ecthelion: but all different glowy stars leadership stacks
Valheru: ye goiod
Valheru: btw i thought of stat stuff for level 10 heroes/units
Valheru: to fill in weakness's of races
Valheru: for example u could give gimli a passive talent that gives small speed bonus to units
Valheru: or a passive weapon upg
Valheru: like aoe on standard wep
Valheru: etc
Aulë|Ecthelion: i personaly think that speed or more leaderships won't be necesary (unless they are inmune to debuff)
Aulë|Ecthelion: dwarf needs upgrades more viable
Aulë|Ecthelion: and same applies for Men and elf infantry
Valheru: theres a way to make a power that gives a horde upgrades
Valheru: free
Valheru: anyway its a general idea atm
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea we even have the bfme1 rohan guys fx for that
Aulë|Ecthelion: and the sounds, and everything
Aulë|Ecthelion: but my point is
Aulë|Ecthelion: gimli leadership is better than upgrades vs Elves
Aulë|Ecthelion: but this leadership is pretty useless vs isen
Valheru: not a fan of 50% on heroes
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea i think i mentioned you
Aulë|Ecthelion: i would like to convert all 50% leaderships on 33%
Aulë|Ecthelion: or 35 or something like that
Aulë|Ecthelion: anyways
Aulë|Ecthelion: thing is, if i take upgrades vs isen
Aulë|Ecthelion: saruman will still one-hit my shits
Aulë|Ecthelion: heros are too much better than upgrades, and this is from ur design of 1.7 tbh. Heros stronger
Valheru: we're getting there, at least we did a lot of upgrade accesibility stuff
Valheru: i like thr forge changes
Aulë|Ecthelion: yes that was excelent
Aulë|Ecthelion: men upgrades are lovely
Aulë|Ecthelion: but...
Aulë|Ecthelion: men heavy armor is nerfed since 1.05
Aulë|Ecthelion: while isen pike HA is improved by a damage scalar of 70, men HAs are nerfed by one of 120
Valheru: i thought u did some men stuff in 109
Aulë|Ecthelion: i did at first but it meant nothing
Aulë|Ecthelion: they had the damage scalars twice and i removed one
Aulë|Ecthelion: but game had never readed the two damage scalars anyways
Aulë|Ecthelion: i figured out too late and i didn't dare to buff at that stage of beta
Valheru: oh
Aulë|Ecthelion: maybe... if blacksmith was even cheaper
Aulë|Ecthelion: and heavy armor was on level 1
Aulë|Ecthelion: like with eregion forge
Aulë|Ecthelion: there would be no need to buff the stats
Valheru: is it shit on rohs?
Aulë|Ecthelion: alone ye
Aulë|Ecthelion: but rohirrims are usually with eomer leadership
Aulë|Ecthelion: which is basicaly a better heavy armor
Valheru: gay system
Aulë|Ecthelion: but if eomer was 33%
Aulë|Ecthelion: and upgrades were trully 50%
Aulë|Ecthelion: that would be the same
Aulë|Ecthelion: vs factions without debuff
Valheru: do that if u want, throw himo exp if he doesnt have it
Valheru: i gna play game of dota
Aulë|Ecthelion: that game still exists'
Valheru: ye very rarely play
Valheru: u cunts taking all my time with playing bfme
Valheru: lol
Aulë|Ecthelion: when are you gonna unnistall that garbage bra
Valheru: bra i seeing some big atak trol reps
Valheru: val proud
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea they are pretty fine
Aulë|Ecthelion: but MT are better, and you finally saw it i think
Aulë|Ecthelion: u got rektd by them
Valheru: that pisd me off lol, had nothin in base, game was won
Aulë|Ecthelion: lel
Aulë|Ecthelion: trollcage armor is also farm armor
Aulë|Ecthelion: that's why pikes can't counter it
Aulë|Ecthelion: 4 SH trollcage is basicaly a perfect opening
Valheru: but is it psychological, are ppl actually tring with swords>? probs dont know
Aulë|Ecthelion: u can't try with swords
Aulë|Ecthelion: because you get crushed, that simple
Aulë|Ecthelion: lel
Aulë|Ecthelion: and the little orc boys in the mordor barricades really like cavalry
Aulë|Ecthelion: but don't worry i just learnt this, next time i will pike+sword glute ;)
Valheru: i like where we have all troll types atm, fuk im amazing
Valheru: dnt wori about cage bra, the crush nerfs is enuf
Aulë|Ecthelion: drummers not so popular
Valheru: i think thats a knowledge thing tho
Valheru: i seen glute n ryan use
Valheru: kep em close to other trol
Aulë|Ecthelion: ah btw
Aulë|Ecthelion: i wanted to send you replays
Aulë|Ecthelion: i prepared a "lame for val" folder
Aulë|Ecthelion: did i send you that already?
Valheru: preti sure i watched em all, check facebook msg date
Aulë|Ecthelion: did you find trolls and ling action?
Valheru: i cant remember hoinestly my medication rly shits on my memory
Valheru: lings seem fine tho?
Valheru: i havent seen any real abuse
Aulë|Ecthelion: ok lel
Aulë|Ecthelion: will later chek reps
Aulë|Ecthelion: well, they are definetively lame in big maps
Aulë|Ecthelion: because you can't punish inmediatly
Valheru: one of those units thats either broken or shit, but i think we prety close to perfect
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea not perfect definetively
Aulë|Ecthelion: but i think we already nerfed them a bit on actual beta
Valheru: 2 much iu th ink i did
Valheru: * i think
Valheru: i dnt think pierce is the problem after playing a bit
Aulë|Ecthelion: nah, that's a fine measure
Aulë|Ecthelion: but what i consider a extrem nerf is lurtz
Aulë|Ecthelion: like i said yesterday
Aulë|Ecthelion: Elves vs Isen is actually balanced if it wasn't because of devastation+saruman combos
Aulë|Ecthelion: Isen vs Gob also pretty balanced on 1.09, althought requires a very agressive gameplay
Aulë|Ecthelion: i don't even see the point of nerfing even more against specific shelob
Aulë|Ecthelion: Gandy survives lurtz cripple, but ofc some nerf is more than welcome

Valheru: fuk now that im playing i dont want to patch
Valheru: lol
Aulë|Ecthelion: good
Aulë|Ecthelion: better
Aulë|Ecthelion: but if you find a cancerouos situation u want to stop playing and patch, like it happened me 3 hours ago
Aulë|Ecthelion: with scorp isen :P
Valheru: i think industry should reduce armor by 15%
Aulë|Ecthelion: na, bad idea
Aulë|Ecthelion: your SH seemed stronk
Aulë|Ecthelion: because the SH is stronk
Aulë|Ecthelion: or mordor barricades too effective
Valheru: i think its cooldown issue
Valheru: n its about time we nerf hobbits
Valheru: i just want a small hp nerf
Valheru: powers are ok now
Aulë|Ecthelion: the heros
Aulë|Ecthelion: meatshield against the arrows
Valheru: im referring to non hero
Aulë|Ecthelion: without heros the little hordes die pretty ez
Valheru: also tom is gay, i dont know why u added LD, he is so strong for tier 2
Valheru: sometimes does more than 15pp
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea tom OP
Aulë|Ecthelion: but leadership is good
Aulë|Ecthelion: it's for elf only
Valheru: i alrdy nerfed punch radius
Aulë|Ecthelion: ye that was perfect
Valheru: but i would like to see him killable
Aulë|Ecthelion: yes
Aulë|Ecthelion: that.
Aulë|Ecthelion: armies always prefer to dodge him
Valheru: so do we want to make him deal less dmg to pikes, or take big crush revenge
Valheru: one hits everything
Aulë|Ecthelion: crush revenge thing no
Aulë|Ecthelion: i would like if swords
Aulë|Ecthelion: dealt a fuckin something on him
Aulë|Ecthelion: since he already one hits them
Valheru: nvr looked at his armorset tbh
Aulë|Ecthelion: it's similar to shelob
Aulë|Ecthelion: or mounted mos
Valheru: slash 25%
Aulë|Ecthelion: he could also take hero
Valheru: its useless tho for factions like mordor, mostly t1 heroes
Aulë|Ecthelion: ye
Valheru: we can just nerf pierce slash anmd pike
Aulë|Ecthelion: if we nerf to pierce
Aulë|Ecthelion: LA kills him
Aulë|Ecthelion: and if we nerf uruk (orc damage)
Aulë|Ecthelion: uruk kill him flanking while he walks
Valheru: it wont be that big of a nerf, hes got big hp
Valheru: still big punch too
Aulë|Ecthelion: oh, and cavalry
Aulë|Ecthelion: also, this whole armorset kind
Aulë|Ecthelion: is too strong to cavalry
Valheru: ill test 20% nerf to those and see if he can die
Aulë|Ecthelion: shelob one hits all kind of cavalry
Aulë|Ecthelion: and takes almost zero dmg from things like lancers knights rohirim etc
Valheru: bcoz cant dismount like evrythiung else
Valheru: but can nerf a bit
Valheru: also i wana give an elf hero some sort of pillage power
Aulë|Ecthelion: fitton once came to me with that request :p
Aulë|Ecthelion: all factions have a economy thing
Aulë|Ecthelion: except his beloved elfs
Valheru: and isen have like 5 or some shit
Aulë|Ecthelion: but i don't want promote hero dependency for elfs
Aulë|Ecthelion: maybe improve mallorn productivity / armor?
Aulë|Ecthelion: oh... and talking about armors
Aulë|Ecthelion: did you know some barrracks have farm armor?
Valheru: orc pit?
Aulë|Ecthelion: and gob cave
Aulë|Ecthelion: i learned that reading 2.02 changelog
Valheru: ye coz guardians piss on it in 2 hits
Aulë|Ecthelion: all this years i have been wasting pikes
Aulë|Ecthelion: on gob caves
Aulë|Ecthelion: i thought it was that you overbuffed cave hp rofl
Valheru: i am not sure when that happened, but ive a feeling its not been changed since game launch
Aulë|Ecthelion: never yeah
Aulë|Ecthelion: lel
Aulë|Ecthelion: may i suit all structures ingame?
Aulë|Ecthelion: if gob caves died by pikes it would actually help lategame balance
Aulë|Ecthelion: and also
Aulë|Ecthelion: can we nerf flanking bonus of cavalry
Aulë|Ecthelion: wargs one-hit guardian with heavy armor
Aulë|Ecthelion: oh,
Aulë|Ecthelion: i also have a good tool to fix that
Valheru: is that on weapon?
Valheru: i wouldnt touch other cav bcoz ur just promoting more hero gayness
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea
Valheru: things like witchking need flank penalty
Aulë|Ecthelion: come i want to show you

SilverBane`: grond needs nerf and be available on ringheroes mode only


<< Valheru joined the room >>
Valheru: Weapon WargCrush 350% bit overkill
Valheru: or u mean their hit?
Valheru: hit doesnt get flank bonus its only on armor iirc
Aulë|Ecthelion: ye that 350
Valheru: is that 106?
Aulë|Ecthelion: since 1.5 ye
Aulë|Ecthelion: rohirrim is also 350

Aulë|Ecthelion: ofc 20 is too big
Aulë|Ecthelion: i have pushed 13 or 17
Aulë|Ecthelion: on my branch
Aulë|Ecthelion: 13 ye
<< Valheru Aborted Game >>
Aulë|Ecthelion: did u even see the pull request?
Valheru: i personally think u should avoid that and reduce  warg flank
Valheru: or do both but start with smaller value like 7%
Aulë|Ecthelion: ye warg flank can be reduced eitherway
Aulë|Ecthelion: https://github.com/ValheruGR/BFME2/pull/4
Valheru: is that pike thing global?
Aulë|Ecthelion: obviuosly
Aulë|Ecthelion: there's no punish for having ur pikes on agresive
Aulë|Ecthelion: just a buff
Aulë|Ecthelion: and minimal penalty
Valheru: ill apporove it but change that 13 to a 7 and sort our wargs
Valheru: obv we wont know for sure til beta but be gentle to start
Aulë|Ecthelion: about that
Aulë|Ecthelion: if we being too carefully with this
Aulë|Ecthelion: why aren't we doing the same with lurtz?
Aulë|Ecthelion: 50% nerf from patch to patch
Aulë|Ecthelion: while he only looks op vs FoL heros
Aulë|Ecthelion: (i mean pin duration and cooldown)
Valheru: i nerfed his pin pretty heavy
Valheru: and want to remove armor bonus in carnage
Valheru: plus more exp required for pillage
Aulë|Ecthelion: did u know bt2dc increased carnage radius?
Aulë|Ecthelion: and also increased guardian exp awards?
Valheru: dno my memories fukd up
Aulë|Ecthelion: carnage thing didn't appaer in their changelog
Aulë|Ecthelion: they buffed zerks
Aulë|Ecthelion: and affect lurtz carnage
Valheru: i rly hate that hero, 1100g for 3k worth
Aulë|Ecthelion: i want to separate that carnage radius buff
Aulë|Ecthelion: on 1.09 i separated it for dwarf units
Aulë|Ecthelion: i want to separate it for all 3 ranks hordes
Aulë|Ecthelion: staying big radius vs orcs and gobs
Valheru: sure
Valheru: and if we remove armor
Valheru: 2 much nerf vs elf?
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea
Aulë|Ecthelion: but radius restore on elf hordes will be good
Aulë|Ecthelion: atm faggot lurtz put in the middle of ur LA archers while they shoot something else
Aulë|Ecthelion: casts carnage and gg, u have to run
Aulë|Ecthelion: or he gets level 5 soon
Valheru: how abotu we try armor removed totally and see wot happens
Valheru: n u do ur carnage weapons
Valheru: at least th en its less faceroll, if lurtz goes carnage u can try focus
Aulë|Ecthelion: oh, and he needs penalty vs fortresses
Aulë|Ecthelion: nasty lurtz
Valheru: btw i saw in reps ur gay dworf heroes raping forts
Valheru: and tough hero armor is a joke vs fort fire
Aulë|Ecthelion: :d
Aulë|Ecthelion: dwarf can have some more penalty, but it has to be on the all the dwarf heros
Aulë|Ecthelion: not just gimli
Aulë|Ecthelion: to keep proportion
Valheru: jus a bit
Valheru: but the strucutual fort fite is useless
Aulë|Ecthelion: then glorfindel can also have vs fort
Valheru: even with fire arrows u have to focus every tower on em
Aulë|Ecthelion: actually
Aulë|Ecthelion: wanna improve fort vs hero dmg? lel
Valheru: gud idea
Aulë|Ecthelion: but i would like fort expansions
Aulë|Ecthelion: took a bit more hero dmg
Aulë|Ecthelion: they take less than the fort itself lol
Valheru: why one horde kills in 2s
Aulë|Ecthelion: horde. not a hero
Valheru: n ur gay hobbits
Aulë|Ecthelion: most of the times i just want to take down the towers with my dwarf heros
Valheru: alls ur doing is making the fort hero armor buff useless
Aulë|Ecthelion: and ends up being more effective to directly take the fort down
Valheru: na fuk that its gaymode
Valheru: i am sorting out whirlwind
Aulë|Ecthelion: and move it to a higher level for cow sake
Valheru: ye mybe or exp req
Valheru: and also i nerfing slayer to aragorn
Aulë|Ecthelion: why u want it on level 5
Aulë|Ecthelion: it looks bad
Valheru: its k radius going downa bit
Aulë|Ecthelion: and keep it on lvl 7
Aulë|Ecthelion: nerfed or not!
Aulë|Ecthelion: ah
Aulë|Ecthelion: Valheru: why one horde kills in 2s
Aulë|Ecthelion: about tower expansions
Aulë|Ecthelion: actually swords don't really kill it
Aulë|Ecthelion: pikemen do
Aulë|Ecthelion: stupid pikmene who are also the toughest units against structural dmg
Valheru: is it
Aulë|Ecthelion: also, Fortress silverthorn and Dwarf blue axes
Aulë|Ecthelion: are double structural dmg right
Aulë|Ecthelion: look this:
Aulë|Ecthelion: Armor PikemenHeavyArmor
Aulë|Ecthelion:   Armor = STRUCTURAL   20%
Aulë|Ecthelion:     Armor = FLAME               75%
Aulë|Ecthelion: that means 2-3 upgraded pikes can take down all towers (or the fortress) without die
Aulë|Ecthelion: which happened in the replay you made silver
Aulë|Ecthelion: while if it was any other fort with fire, pikes 'd die
Valheru: so wots solution
Aulë|Ecthelion: dwarf fort needs some kind of compensation in lategame vs pikes
Aulë|Ecthelion: and all tower expansions need to take less pikemen
Aulë|Ecthelion: and more swordmen
Aulë|Ecthelion: i mean hero
Aulë|Ecthelion: not swordmen
Valheru: ud have to nerf forge blade weapons to dworf fort
Valheru: coz u cant rly buff against armor upgrades
Aulë|Ecthelion: exacctly
Aulë|Ecthelion: but fort dying doesn't worry me
Aulë|Ecthelion: worries me all my barracks dying vs upgraded pikes
Aulë|Ecthelion: and my blue axes of fort not doing shit on them
Valheru: why dont u just increase fort upg towers base dmg
Valheru: their shit anmyway
Valheru: elf dworf
Aulë|Ecthelion: it's double base dmg
Aulë|Ecthelion: structural dmg counters very well balrog
Aulë|Ecthelion: (better than magic)
Valheru: so just nerf uruk pike FB then
Valheru: structure penalty globally
Valheru: do wargs while ur at it
Aulë|Ecthelion: wat i do to them?
Aulë|Ecthelion: 275% flanking bonus from 350?
Aulë|Ecthelion: would be the average of 200% (knight) and 350
Valheru: yeh but i talking forge blades too, structural penalty in weapon
Valheru: like we did with corsairs
Valheru: fukj they were gay
Valheru: i hate it how as soon as isen upgrades appear its steamroll
Valheru: mostly pike
Valheru: and 2 wargs with FB on fort
Valheru: love seeing rohs do it but thats late game as shit
Aulë|Ecthelion: also warg HA stronger to structural than to fire
Aulë|Ecthelion: bad vs dwarf
Aulë|Ecthelion: it occured to me
Aulë|Ecthelion: giving FLAME damage type to upgraded axes
Valheru: oh ye gud idea
Aulë|Ecthelion: but that would kill the diversity
Aulë|Ecthelion: and it would be weird mines get raped :P
Aulë|Ecthelion: ohh
Aulë|Ecthelion: bane gave me idea
Aulë|Ecthelion: SilverBane`: should only stay vs infantry
Aulë|Ecthelion: we can have both dmg types
Aulë|Ecthelion: fak, good good
Valheru: right
Valheru: i need timeout
Valheru: im guna do haradrim fire arrows too
Valheru: but u can do the stats 4 it
Aulë|Ecthelion: it's already coded eh
Aulë|Ecthelion: dont need any model
Aulë|Ecthelion: just enable
Valheru: is it in the model alrdy, have u seen
Valheru: fire tips
Aulë|Ecthelion: yes i think
Aulë|Ecthelion: enable and chek
Valheru: k im off ill look at ur new stuff 2nite


Farmer Lau: shelob 1 shots any cav, kills heroes with stinger, disrupts yo army, swords die, bows are whatever unless u make millions

									if

									men elf			Gondor soldiers shields now yes can be strenghted without become op on Land. All men units stop being Wood dependent. HA penalties can be gone.
									men dwarf		Good game dynamics for both factions. Wood less op early game Gimli less op middle game.
									men isen		Lone towers can have a purpose now if debuff drives me crazy. I WOULD LIKE THEODEN became one of this new Stacky spell leaderships.
									men gob			Good for gobs. And if we give men a Stacky Spell
									men mordor		Good for mordor. MEN NEEDS A STACKY SPELL. BOROMIR / THEODEN BEING THE SAME IS BAD.
									elf dwarf		 Good. Tier 2 elf wood should have any kind of compensation...
									elf isen		Arwen now yes can be properly effective with lancers. Good. Tier 2 elf wood should have any kind of compensation...
									elf gob				No more bullshit of SR in defensive stance with land crushing pikes. SR pike armor can be slightly restored to pikes again. Arwen now yes can be properly effective with lancers.
									elf mordor			Elf suffer too much from taint land. Not anymore, but only this mu worries me. ORCS CAN BE BUFFED AGAIN THO
									dwarf isen			I have chances vs debuff with wagon+dain, and gimli is less necesary. Happy.
									dwarf mordor		Orcs in defensive stance with land have always been a pain in the ass for early game. Gimli armor nerfed so also good here.
									dwarf gob			If debuff drives me cracy i can get Dain+Wagon stacking. Excelent. Also gimli less OP which is welcomed by all match ups.
									isen vs gob			Promotes gorkil vs isen, which is not usual. Taint land irrelevant here.
									isen vs mordor		Taint land less op, promotes eye. I like this.
									mordor vs gob		I like goblin now have a leadership to survive naz debuff.
