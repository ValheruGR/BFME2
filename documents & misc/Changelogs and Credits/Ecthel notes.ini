	-Re add old icons. Mappers need it! New icons should come in a new file!.
	-new mordor fortress sound: volumen like 5 times higher than everything else.
	-drogoth spawn laggy for low lod
		;need u online to fix this properly
-HC for muma? it's such a big object, how cant u make one
=======

Witch king curse to do something else at same time it curses? Like a slow poison then turn into barrow wights? Poison allows targeed units to display poison nugget so it would be nice to have the cured heroes with a nugget.

-drogoth incinerate puts me to 10fps.

-If REbuild is giving an armor bonus, can you make a fx as it was a leadership? no nuget ofc. -What? its usually cast on forts, I aint making some massive leadership fx for big buildings
  -make tornado affect allies?????? so it can stop acting as a shield bubble that damages others.
  -dunedains broken again
 -Replace Restore and Athelas nuggets by fxs? WK style.

;;-------------------------------------Chats-----------------------;;
	Ok for conversations you use 
		; Green, 
			-i use blak.
	Use tab also, u will see.

		
	-Elrond rain spawn laggy for me. And stupid if you ask me. 
		;eCH RETRY IT NOW. - DOES IT STILL LAG on LOW?
			-Yes, not inmediatly, but after it starts acumulating water in the floor.
			
	-DS lags a bit. 20 fps in lowest. 10 fps in high details. And fire spawn doesnt rlly match at the end. In fact it should stop damaging at the end.
		;-DS - DOES IT STILL LAG ON LOW??
			aparently no, i guess you removed fire in floor fx. Which looks pretty bad cuz i can't tell if there is "damage" or not.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 	-stupid lady crying in elf sounds
  	-Beta has added some more particles or changed the old ones on wk screech on foot, and thse lags me unnecesarely because fx looks the fucken same. (by the way, red-black fx everywhere is boring already... warchant, sauron gay stuff, wk, fb screechs, blackriders)
	-Dain train allies icon doesn't really contrasts with the others. looks like bme1 attack movement icon.
	-Gloin EQ is synchronized like shit.
 	-GET WK death sound fx from the movie and put it here? WK even has a nice death animations, fx can come after.
	-can we nerf Flyers plow weapon to avoid one hiting strong units inside tunnel.
	-mordor catapult select box too big
 	-I 'd like to reduce heroes leadership radius again. Debuff stuff still counters them effectively and only rapes violentally the balance vs factions without debuff. Simple dmg/armor ones at least (theo lurtz haldir). They are 275 and originally 200. I propose 225.
	-In rohan banner and knight banner there's a showsubobject module triggered by Upgrade_DwarvenMithrilMail, which is not granted anywhere. Does this mean u had an HD model for mounted banners which is not showing up?
		//-----art feedback---------------
		-Gimli coat annoying and ugly? Bad movement, bad size looks like a king. I mentioned it already somewhere.
		-Fellbeast & WK mounted select box too big! fix fix fix! It's due the wings. eagle&drogoth dont't have select box in wings. - having weird issues trying to fix this
		-since i do cosmetics on my TW, people wants me to get rid of most elven heroe spell icons lol. So you can deduce these icons dont rlly have a posive feedback, only hate or indiference. 
		-arwen to have different icon on lvl 10
		-Horde Respawn needs to be differenced from Fortress/Well respawn again. Perhaps a rainbow is not a big deal considering it's 2 colors per faction.
		-fix cave trolls leveled up not getting stoned model. 
			;try to get a screenshot.  
				-U HAVE IT in documents & misc/#Testing Maps/VadosDelIsenTesting09ForStoneTrolls_sch01
		-gimli lvl 5 icon is shit?
		-is it anoted that all Saru fx (spawn, sharknado class b shit) suck bad? OH yes; here it is.
			-saruman spawn extremely annoying and lvl 10 still being a sharknado cancer. while it also doesnt run any fx in low lod.
				-Let me make a good BLUE not pink thunder bolt storm? Wizard tower style.
		-the annoying 1.09 men rax sound
		-109 switcher doesn't work on other directorys. noob parahmanta
		-level 2 & level 3 isen floors are barely differencibla. I MISS ORANGE WITH ALL MY HEART

	-Beserkers need a new model entirely.

			;;-----------------------------------------------
	If *A*, *B*, and *C* happen;
		;men elf			
			Gondor soldiers shields now yes can be strenghted without become op on Land. All men units stop being Wood dependent. HA penalties can be gone. Faramir / Eomer will be in a nasty position, but Legolas Thranduil ranged damage can be reduced into the average of 1.06 and 1.09 values.
		;men dwarf		
			Good game dynamics for both factions. Wood less op early game Gimli less op middle game. Hero spam not so unstoppeable, warf army not so unstoppeable.
		;men isen		
			Lone towers can have a purpose now if debuff drives me crazy. I WOULD LIKE THEODEN became one of this new Stacky spell leaderships.
		;men gob			
			Good for gobs. And if we give men a Stacky Spell
		;men mordor	
			Good for mordor. MEN NEEDS A STACKY SPELL. BOROMIR / THEODEN BEING THE SAME IS BAD.
		;elf dwarf	
			Good. Tier 2 elf wood should have any kind of compensation...
		;elf isen	
			Arwen now yes can be properly effective with lancers. Good. Tier 2 elf wood should have any kind of compensation...
		;elf gob			
			No more bullshit of SR in defensive stance with land crushing pikes. SR pike armor can be slightly restored to pikes again. Arwen now yes can be properly effective with lancers.
		;elf mordor		
			Elf suffer too much from taint land. Not anymore, but only this mu worries me. ORCS CAN BE BUFFED AGAIN THO
		;dwarf isen	
			I have chances vs debuff with wagon+dain, and gimli is less necesary. Happy.
		;dwarf mordor	
			Orcs in defensive stance with land have always been a pain in the ass for early game. Gimli armor nerfed so also good here.
		;dwarf gob		
			If debuff drives me cracy i can get Dain+Wagon stacking. Excelent. Also gimli less OP which is welcomed by all match ups.
		;isen vs gob		
			Promotes gorkil vs isen, which is not usual. Taint land irrelevant here.
		;isen vs mordor
			Taint land less op, promotes eye. I like this.
		;mordor vs gob	
			I like goblin now have a leadership to survive naz debuff.
