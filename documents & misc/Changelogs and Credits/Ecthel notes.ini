-About spiderlings

	*since evil farms now take 50% cavalry dmg from 45%. to have identical damage of 1.09 spiderlings should have the following numbers. This should have been our start point.

		DamageScalar  = 76.5% NONE +ECONOMY_STRUCTURE ;;-;; 80% ; ; 85 ;;-;; 
			*About your extra penalties against Tunnels/furnaces: it's obvious double/tripple ling rush is gonna rape your farms, that's what happens when you are playing bad. The problem goblins are not being penaltied enough for this lazy gameplay because:
				1: CAVALRY is being completly countered once you have 2 spiderlings. (hence the next scalar i propose)
				2: SWORD/PIKE COMBINATIONS are being countered you have SHELOB. Bitch's base damage is still too high considered in 1.08 she's got both DAMAGE and DELAYBETWEENSHOTS improved AT SAME TIME. In 2.06 she was 250dmg each 1666, now she's 300 dmg each 1200. On beta we only changed it to 280 each 1200.
 		
	*since 1.09 increased spiderling base damage without touching scalars, to have identical damage against farms (which was fine), WHILE ALSO CONSIDERING CURRENT ARMOR CHANGE, we need:
		
	//pushinThis//	DamageScalar  = 71.4% NONE +ECONOMY_STRUCTURE ;;-;; 76.5% ;;-;; 80% ; ; 85 ;;-;; 
		
		
	*since 1.09 increased spiderling base damage without touching scalars, to have identical damage against cavalry of 1.08 (which was not bad) and BARRACKS (which was already lame) we need
		
	//pushinThis//	DamageScalar  = 108% NONE +CAVALRY ;;-;; 120% NONE +CAVALRY; ; 110% NONE +CAVALRY
	//pushinThis//	DamageScalar  = 79% NONE +FS_FACTORY ;;-;; 83% ;;-;; 85%
		
 
	*since 1.08 increased shelob damage / DBS at once, i propose to revert dmg completly. we have already played with -30 dmg. That way some cavalry units will also stop being one-hited without Bats.
	//pushinThis//	#define WILD_SHELOB_STINGER_DAMAGE				250 ;;-;; 270 ;;-;; 300 ; ; 250

gandalf speed?

compare a lvl 10 drogoth/fb/wk mounted dmg on structures/heroes.



thranduil select box annoying


-saruman levels 5-8 exp required needs to go up a little bit
- cave trolls need to take about 10% less from structural- 

-Vals sick fukcing ideas

-make ranger longshot deal less damage, but a bit bigger area, and make it slow effected hordes by 25% speed and 10s duration.
-make tom have an aura that slows down isengard hordes(would have to seperate men tom from elf tom)

- We need to look at horde HP gains from 5-10 a bit more serious. Look how much we did for high level monsters. You know when ur fighting level 10 attack trolls and mumas, coz u cant kill them. 

If you add up the HP gains from 1-10 and then think about how much it does in game, its actually fuck all for most cavalry and many hordes too. Its like what,  one extra hit from a hero if even that? pathetic. I dont want to touch damage but HP definately needs some bigger improvements. I going to play with some numbers, wana see how it goes.
Note, theres only a few units i want to do this too


rhovanion has 4560 zoom?

CRASH and OOS AT men wood. - ECH WAS THIS MEN WOOD OR ELF WOOD? BCOZ IF IT WAS ELF I THINK I KNOW WHY





-Ok i was thinking this morning and i think this is a good idea.
	-Bats/Crebain reload time now 165 from 150. (Originally 180)
	-RallyingCall (not warchant) reload time now 135 from 120. (Originally 120)

	
	1: leeadership dependency to perform any minimal attack is stupid. 
	2: I have always hated crebain/Bats abuse. In previous patch i wanted to extend the cooldown gap between RC & Debuff. But now i realised i can satisfy that need without break the balance against dwarf rush. (Need that is also fixed for gob since tunnels stopped having idiotic farm armor)
	3: Since wood's are nerfed, Rc needs some kind of penalty.
	4: I have already been saying for years that fast RC reload also implies Dwarf/Elf being superior against factions without debuff (Men). Guardians feel continously under RC, which is enough to one hit soldiers. Same with lorien Archers, who can get pwned by swords if they start with FS against elf wood.
	5: can also be considered a compensation AGAINST nerfed elf wood/taint land.

	6: i can't remember what else to say, but im convinced of this. And im aware bats/crebain still have nerfed duration, which i want to keep anyways.





-I personally hate RC fx. Feels metalic.
-idea. all the stupid skin changes based on ranks to match with the bonuses.
-idea. mountain trolls to have deceleration.
 - Eomer Spear needs testing and adjusting vs wagons, so does wounding arrow. So does Theoden melee and faramir regular weapon


	
	
We should prefer to **DESIGN** a MotW GOOD gameplay first & balance after. 
At the moment all i see is: 
	-all or nothing gondor archer spam (which is easily dodgeable without consequences because they can't hurt your fortress farms)
	-this "easily dodgeable armies" trying to mean something by making trebuchets & some towers. 
	-soldiers not rushing farms, knights rushing farms, 
	-perhaps some good theoden knight rohirrims combinations (which are more frequent on this beta than normal 09)
	-level 2 towerguard after a creep attacking a fortress with a soldier in elf wood or with Rc.
	-aragorn dependency to win vs Mordor & Elves.
	-Gandalf dependency to have a "balanced" lategame.
	-no upgrades because if people feel soldiers are useless on early game, in lategame they would be even more useless.  (even if we improved them)


-I need you to make a eowyn disguised model ON FOOT. so we can make eowyn disguise dismounted and be able to fight pikes.



guardian Hc color idea: SHIELD


;;-----------------------------------------------;;
-How about this. I want to try this!


-Increase SoG and AoG HP by 10 or 20. 
-Nerf AoG level up to 2. (gondor archer experience levels makes them only good vs goblins tbh, once they are level 2 they start pwning your gobs cuz +20 hp per level)
-   -20% poison armor for both.
-reduce KNIGHT LEVEL 2-3-4 DDAMAGE GAINS. they are designed to have weak damage, but once they level up they become a normal farm-raping-cavalry. that's another of the causes men is a "playable" faction considering infantry is useless by itself.
-Nerf aragorn blademaster & let me nerf gandalf wizard blast until the point it matches exactly the fX. I hate invisible damage.
-Mordor Orcs/archers bonus vs SoG, AoG. Haradrim no need.
-Corsair bonus vs SoG.
 ;;;;;-Knight Stable HP to match archeryrange/rax. ( this is independent of previous set of ideas tho)
 


;;-----------------------------------------------;;


goat is now a bit harder to click

 


Valheru: wilds of forochel is fine, i hate snow maps personally tho



-add gob atra.




 
-Shelob to take more structural?

-Tom knocking down tier 3 heroes is fuking bullshit
	;; i think ther'es no way to filter 3k heroes but i will keep trying.
 
-sauron looks seriously homosexual in high lod. did you do that in purpose? Nobodi liking but u (cuz u homo)
 
 
-Grima debuff nugget looks like shit. U making more nuggets for nothing. In big game the engine ends up confusing nuggets (independently of LoD)


;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;MAPS;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

 ;Valheru: anfalas is good but it needs neutral lairs next to outpost/signal
 ;Valheru: Arnor is alright but its snow, and not sure if anyone will play it given narrow passages and uneven terrain
 ;Valheru: canyons of khand is alright, dont think it will be popular but its gud enuf
	Valheru: however some terrain goes over fort floors, needs slight flatten at start positions
	E: silver said chokepoints are lame
	E: camera is weird but can be fixed
	E: if worths it.
	Valheru: yeh lets keep it tho
;Valheru: i love druadan forrest but outposts have no lairs
Valheru: add neutrals and itl be great map
E: i added these outposts actually
E: map was too big and i wanted to add these 2 places of player focus
Valheru: yeah but uncontesed outposts is gaymode
E: maybe i get silver to add something in the 4 corners of the map
E: like rivers or something
E: to make the playable area smaller
Valheru: i l ike it but plz add warg lairs
E: k
;Valheru: emyn muil is ok, boring but different terrain

 ;Valheru: greenleaf forrest is so beautiful but replace lings with wargs
Valheru: i fukjing hate lings they rape builders
Valheru: and get units stuck
 Valheru: harad is fine but instead of 2 goblin lairs near outposts, just put 1 right next to it. The lairs are too close to base, awful for FoD
 Valheru: Westmarch is a good size but theres outposts right next to base. Move them somewhere futher away and add warg lairs
 ;Valheru: Nan marillion is nice but lighting too vibrant
 Valheru: cool
Valheru: rhovannian steps is great
Valheru: but add a central signal and some wargs

	SilverNoob map review
		woody end - maybe some fix on cliff textures, but alright

 		blackroot vale - X - ugly confusing green everywhere (not even paths) and ugly large river in mid. only waterfall unplayable side is beauiful

SLEEPING FOREST NEEDS DES


jungles of harad lighting

Valheru: westmarch is alrite but everyone starts with an Inn(no creep)
Valheru: yeh its a decent shape and stuff, terrains alrite, but not much happening. can u just put a warg or goblin lair in place of inns?


work as leadership icon for both dain and gimli. 
	-ICONS: saruman dominate icon is dumb. looks like some soul stealing thing. - 
		Yes idiot, because thats exactly what dominate does.
			;na, thats fanciful and gay like warcraft! even in the movie it's just a influence.





Valheru: ok u may aswell do Spire whilst ur coding
Valheru: mighty cata etc
Valheru: and witchking DBS














  gondor archer needs armor or health. 
 
You know that abusing of Scale = X thing you just fuck up selection boxes & nuggets right? (select boxes dont change, nuggets do)


   


	 
 

;;-------------------------Ecth.Notes----------------------;;
 	-QUESTION: I have the fix for dwarf heavy armor. They needed a production update module. Do you still want to make single purchase tiny upgrades, so the armor can be stronger!
	-QUESTION: In rohan banner and knight banner there's a showsubobject module triggered by Upgrade_DwarvenMithrilMail, which is not granted anywhere. Does this mean u had an HD model for mounted banners which is not showing up?
	-ICONS: the Only icon that has sucked bad since the beggining of bfme1 is boromir Train Allies and you still haven't fixed that.
	-ICONS: I think dain's Train allies icon will work as leadership icon for both dain and gimli. 
 	-ICONS: saruman dominate icon is dumb. looks like some soul stealing thing.
		;Yes idiot, because thats exactly what dominate does.
			na, thats fanciful and gay like warcraft! even in the movie it's just a influence.
	-ICONS: make saruman blast icon more purple instead of blue. check its FX!
	-ICONS: grima icons are cancer
	-MODELS.fortress eagle needs unique skin to distinguish from summones
	-MODELS. that tree model with treebeard legs is shit. 
	-MODELS. make a easterling model with larger pike... and less shitty.
 	-MODELS. HARD TO distinguish GONDOR ARCHER FORM SOLDIER. BANNER CARRIERS WITH SHIELD BAD IDEA. both models are also a bit too grey i think.
	-MODELS. level 2 & level 3 isen floors are barely differencibla. I MISS ORANGE WITH ALL MY HEART
	-FXS: gandalf wop made glute crahs
	-FXS: Can you make farsight4 sound shorter?
	-FXS: SUNFLARE LOOKS STUPID IF NO FX TOUCHES THE GROUND. 
	-FXS. Make eowyn spear thrown slightly different than eomers. Like more gold than eomers.
  	-FXS. We still having the bug of game confusing BuffNugggets, can u delete some? Both Athelas spells can be pure particlesystem. 
		FX_AragornAthBTP
		FX_ElrondAth is beautiful but im sure u can make a particle like these you added on this beta.
		FX_ElrondHealSpecialPower can be a fx. no need to be a nugget of 5secs for 1 power.
		FX_GenericDebuff25Grima absolutely unnecesary. 
	-FXS: Horde Respawn needs to be differenced from Fortress/Well respawn again. Perhaps a rainbow is not a big deal considering it's 2 colors per faction.
	-FXS. MakeDoubt FX purple instead of black/wine? match with icon and debuff nugget. 
		- OK I WILL
	-FXS: Make DISSENT FX morgul green? and a new icon with a green like the old one?!?!?!?!?!!?!? epik
	-FXS: Linear FX for gloin slam? some craks on the ground that make sense regard the hammer animation..
	-FXS: wk mounted death fx is playing in dismounted wk, unless u intentionaly wanted floating shit.
 	-FXS: Gloin EQ is synchronized like shit.
	-FXS: nobody liking mystic fountain piss
	-FXS: is it me or RC fx is ruined with these metalic white fxs?
	-DESIGN: can we nerf Flyers plow weapon to avoid one hiting strong units inside tunnel.
 	-DESIGN: poison arrow dmg bonus vs heroes
	-DESIGN: shelob still way too effective to counter ur beloeved trolls - OK NERF HER VS TROLL
 	-DESIGN: RC TO 35% EXP?
 	-DESIGN: I 'd like to reduce heroes leadership radius again. Debuff stuff still counters them effectively and only rapes violentally the balance vs factions without debuff. Simple dmg/armor ones at least (theo lurtz haldir). They are 275 and originally 200. I propose 225. - OK
	-BOXES: mordor catapult select box too big
	-BOXES: rivendel lancer banner select box is bigger than the horde itself. it's kinda annoying when you are trying to aim the lvl 1 horde, in case it's a group of 2-3lancers.
	-BOXES: Fellbeast & WK mounted select box too big! fix fix fix! It's due the wings. eagle&drogoth dont't have select box in wings. - having weird issues trying to fix this
  		
;;------------------------Val.Notes--------------------;;

 		-Beserkers need a new model entirely.
 		- wagon heal could be a tiny bit higher 
			;tbh i only care they survive something in level 1 when crushing. You need 2-3 wagon to crush a highranked bunch of archers with leadership and ANY kind of heroe near. Wagons are op once you have a group of 4-5 highranked ones.
		- wagons Heavy Armor upgrade? 
			;would be unfair if spider rider didn't have it. but that would be gey modding already.
		- Knights levels 1-3 exp.
			;wat about that? u want more or less? 
		-lots of spells look awful at 460 zoom or whatever it is. I designed them all on 560 height
			;i would keep insisting with 450 zooms tbh.
		-val notes from reps: The trail fx bit too bright too
 	
			

		
		
;;------------------------Balance.Theory------------------------;;
 			- RC 120s CD
			- Land lasts 270s
			-Land CD is 270s
			-Land Penalty 15% armor
			-Crebain/bats 150s CD, 50s duration
 			;Elves vs Men
				//EcthThoughts//: Gondor soldiers shields now yes can be strenghted without become op on Land. All men units stop being Wood dependent. HA penalties can be gone. Faramir / Eomer will be in a nasty position, but Legolas Thranduil ranged damage can be reduced into the average of 1.06 and 1.09 values.
 				-Men wood cooldown buffed
				-Men Wood duration buffed
				-Men wood radius buffed
				-Men wood lost 15% armor
				-The real effects of the wood buffs dont really kick in til after the first recharge. Area buff is tiny, and the lifetime buff is only noticeable at the end of the first spell. So the hardest part of the 15% armor loss for men is the first 4 minutes of the game.
				-Since these first 4 minutes are often the most important, Men will require scalars on elven weapons, small numbers.
				-SoG have 5% shield wall buff but this is not immediately applicable 
  			;Men vs Mordor
				//EcthThoughts//: Good for mordor. MEN NEEDS A STACKY SPELL. BOROMIR / THEODEN BEING THE SAME IS BAD.
 				- I dont think any changes are neccesary here until proper beta happens. Both factions have buffs that are outside of the land armor nerfs
 			;Men vs Dwarves
 				//EcthThoughts//: Good game dynamics for both factions. Wood less op early game Gimli less op middle game. Hero spam not so unstoppeable, warf army not so unstoppeable.
 				- Land nerfs hurt men here, but SoG got bonus to dwarf mines, shield wall buff, and SoG specialist buff(easier creep jacks). I would take an educated guess that Guardians will need a small nerf to SoG/TG/GA
 			;Men vs Isengard
				//EcthThoughts//: Lone towers can have a purpose now if debuff drives me crazy. I WOULD LIKE THEODEN became one of this new Stacky spell leaderships.
 				- Crebain 10s less lifetime, and usually negates Mens land the first time round. Other land buffs will help a lot here. Warg nerfs, shield wall buff, Uruk Hai block nerf and nerf to farm. Not changing anything til beta happens
 			;Men Vs Goblins
 				- Both got same land changes, but gobs usually take bats and men land. Shield wall buff useful here
				//EcthThoughts//: Good for gobs. And if we give men a Stacky Spell
 			;Mordor vs Isengard
				//EcthThoughts//: Taint land less op, promotes eye. I like this.
 				- No changes neccesary upfront as both factions have buffs/nerfs outside of taint land armor nerf. Plus eye/wc is common
 			;Mordor vs Elves
				//EcthThoughts//: Elf suffer too much from taint land. Not anymore, but only this mu worries me. ORCS CAN BE BUFFED AGAIN THO
 				- Land armor nerf hurts here. Hordebonus was buffed though to pierce. But LA will require scalars to Orc Warriors mostly, perhaps a tiny bit to orc archers.
 			;Mordor vs Dwarves
				//EcthThoughts//: Orcs in defensive stance with land have always been a pain in the ass for early game. Gimli armor nerfed so also good here.
 				- Land armor nerf wont affect it much as taking land vs dwarves sucks dick
 			;Mordor vs Goblins
				//EcthThoughts//: I like goblin now have a leadership to survive naz debuff. 
 				- no changes neccesary upfront
 			;Goblins vs Dwarves
 				- taint land sucks dick vs Dwarves, no changes needed upfront
				//EcthThoughts//: If debuff drives me cracy i can get Dain+Wagon stacking. Excelent. Also gimli less OP which is welcomed by all match ups.
 			;Goblins vs Elves
 				- no changes needed upfront
				//EcthThoughts//: No more bullshit of SR in defensive stance with land crushing pikes. SR pike armor can be slightly restored to pikes again. Arwen now yes can be properly effective with lancers.
 			;Goblins vs Isengard
				//EcthThoughts//: Promotes gorkil vs isen, which is not usual. Taint land irrelevant here.
 				- Land pretty uncommon as 1st power, plus uruks got nerfed so did wargs, no changes needed. If anything, Isengard might need help in this mu.
			;Elves vs Dwarves
 				//EcthThoughts//: Good. Tier 2 elf wood should have any kind of compensation...
			;Elves vs Isengard 
 				//EcthThoughts//: Arwen now yes can be properly effective with lancers. Good. Tier 2 elf wood should have any kind of compensation...<
			;Dwarves vs Isengard
				//EcthThoughts//: I have chances vs debuff with wagon+dain, and gimli is less necesary. Happy.

	;;Looks like a piece of shit;; - citadels allow heroe revival. commandset looks ugly with the evacuate buttons, maybe i make dwarven halls with more hp and faster buildtime.


 	-fijarse que nadie use ALL PLAYER UPGRADE para un behavior de balance
	could be cause de oos. probblemente ya lo pense pero en map.ini le estoy dando uso, maybe in 08 too.
	-make USAR MUMAKIL_BUFF_NUGGET
	-TROLL_BUFF_NUGGET
	-move sharku man eater. or do something about convert power. Needs attention.

	//----------------------------------//
	-human heads need some kind of filyer vs ents/mumakils. AND EVEN SHELOB.
	-smite better vs trolls.
	-Command_ToggleCatapultWeapon; test if OK_FOR_MULTI_SELECT works.
	-Fixed Mountain giant throwing rocks animation. (No longer new rocks fall from the sky, instead grab them from the ground)
		-ACTUALLY I COULD ONLY FIX NORMAL WEAPON, BUT BOMBARD WEAPON ANIMATION/REAL WEAPON BECOMES WORSE	
	-I test later if upgraded condition is actually read. The code has always been there but BannerHeavyArmor did not exists in armor.ini lel. 
		-Doesn work. I anote later.
 	-pippin merry don't actually shoot in treebeard. even if i put them in rockmode.
	-https://www.gamereplays.org/community/index.php?showtopic=1010078&pid=10115134&st=0&#entry10115134
	-ai for ring heross
	-Crossbow OP vs FoL. 
 	-soldiers still suck, pierce might still needing to go 140% from 150%. (1.6 they took 125%). 
		-Depends on if we change leaderships.
	-soldiers in block formation could have a 315 FrontAngle, so only 45º from behind are one-hiteables.
		-Depends on if we change leaderships.
	-troll cage floor in level 1 looks upgraded when it's not. can't tell if level 1 or level 2 i think.
 	-Drogoth* autoheal nugget looks too bad. I think it's because your lazzy scale in it's object.
