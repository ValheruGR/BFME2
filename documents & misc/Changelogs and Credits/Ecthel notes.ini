	-shelob lvl 10 is bullshit.
	-Can we make axe throwers deal more damage to swordmen? forged blade -surely sohuld have bonus vs infantry like all other fags
	-Idea. Dwarf rebuild to affect battlewagons. 
	-interesting. 99999 radius is the limit and its not all map.
	-sunflare suck. overnerfed. ;why? doesn't kill upgraded units with leadership.
	-mordor 25pp  suck ;yes ill rethink design
	-pippin merry don't actually shoot in treebeard. even if i put them in rockmode.
	-https://www.gamereplays.org/community/index.php?showtopic=1010078&pid=10115134&st=0&#entry10115134
	-ai for ring heross
	-Orc archer spam on horde bonus is too fast.
	-watever we design for rain of fire, it should affect allies. it's visually annoying to see such big fx not kill weak own units.
	-Crossbow OP vs FoL. 
		//-------------------;; 
	-soldiers still suck, pierce might still needing to go 140% from 150%. (1.6 they took 125%)
	-soldiers in block formation could have a 315 FrontAngle, so only 45º from behind are one-hiteables.
		//--------------------;;
	mumakils are ocupying too much CP with big harad lancer horde, also 15 guys look shit inside the muma. Any idea? child object with less cp is one. Smaller horde for muma is other, but evacuate a unique horde kind is not cool. That's solved by not allowing them to evacuate. But then, i also have people having wet dreams with orc archers or harad archers mounting on muma, but it 'd also look shit.

	So what do you think of 1.00 mumakils? No evacuate icon, 5 inmortal unique harad archers inside with unique weapon. 

	Also, that shti of multi mumakils being impossible to micro due all your army makes space for them can be fixed, but it looks bad. They behave with "transparency" with your own units, like they were normal cavalry among your army. Wat's best? gameplay or realism?
		//--------------------;;		
	--What do you think of this:  ///kindof PASS_EXPERIENCE_TO_CONTAINER

	-Balrog to use hero stance instead of swordmen stance? // this would be better than nerf its actual weapons. Would slightly polish the insane rift between a pro and a average player (that feels balrog is useless)

	-wildmen need some kind of nerf. It's cooldown makes them actually a bit op considering they counter men of dale summon, and also, if they are used to rush and they don't die you will see wildmen 80% of the time

	-Reconsider making 50% armor leaderships (gimli-eomer-wood-taint-drummer-faramir-dwarf statue-gorkil skull) to go 35% Gimli+Dain + Heavy armor  makes dwarf units kinda inmune to 1.09 flood/Sunflare. With your nerfs, elves without thranduil killing dain will suffer around the same or more than in 1.06.
		//---------------------;;
	;;*Saruman Dominate now lasts 17.5s, from 30s
	//this is affecting every convert enemy power... Why not to better keep convert enemy in level 8 as originally?;;
	-make corrode for 5k heros last 45 second 
	;;this is irrelevant now
	//IT IS NOT; from object.ini you are affecting Grima, saruman and even custom heros. revert that!
		//-----------------;;


;;--------------------------language stuff

Valheru: might just put one of haldirs maps into nxt patch
Valheru: call it smthing else, we edited anyway
Valheru: that 3v3 one
Valheru: losarnach
Ecthelion: can't t3a bois fuck off yet? haldir is dead
Ecthelion: all these rotwk maps i stole had owners and t3a fags never cared :D
;Valheru: put lossarnach back in, the one I edited, still have it? I think i put on mediafire
Valheru: also how much faster are phalanx to guardians?



Valheru: its the wiz blast arc which i nerfd hard
Ecthelion:  Modifier = SPELL_DAMAGE 200% // Spell damage doubled   Modifier = RECHARGE_TIME 75% ; ;50%// Spell recharge time halfed (twice as quick to recharge)   Modifier = HEALTH 200
Valheru: the problem is just his blast
Valheru: less radius also slows down the levelling a lot
Ecthelion: i think he would remain op or at least better than other's 5k guys if he still had vanilla blast
Valheru: that arc is pretty heavy herf, lower the recharge on GTW by 10% if u want
Valheru: i dont want gandalf not one-hitting upgraded units if thats wat u want
Ecthelion: why!
Valheru: hes wot makes men l8 game so good
Ecthelion: and also forces the creation of countering hero spam
Ecthelion: thranduil elrond
Ecthelion: grima lurtz saru
Valheru: they all get raped by istari/lw
Valheru: gandy fuks ur units and ur heroes
Ecthelion: hahahaha, so you admit he's annoying af
Ecthelion: op nigger
Valheru: as it should be. dont forget how gay mens slow infantry is late game
Ecthelion: can't we try to make swordmen and general infantry good in lategame? :(
Ecthelion: towerguards are favorite units in lategame now
Valheru: we are, getting there
Valheru: u know, a lot of the problem i see is that tough hero armor is the problem
Valheru: mostly that swordsmen do 0 dmg to it
Ecthelion: tough hero is 3k hero
Ecthelion: he doesnt use that one
Valheru: i know we have a counter system, but its pathetic dmg
Valheru: im talking about elrond aragorn gimli
Ecthelion: bleh, gimli get's raped by swords
Ecthelion: goblin swords at least
Ecthelion: but i guess hat's due poison
Valheru: we should test how many SoG it takes to kill a gimli
Valheru: bcoz i bet its about 9 million
Ecthelion: oh well ye
Ecthelion: without leadesrhip
Ecthelion: and faramir wound arrows taking away 1/3 health bar ye
Valheru: same with lots of pierce
Ecthelion: but instead
Ecthelion: 3 uruks vs gimli
Ecthelion: without use powers
Ecthelion: that might be different
Valheru: uruk not slash right
Valheru: this gay hero armor is a lot of what promotes pike spam late game
Ecthelion: but it's also 25%
Ecthelion: pike spam from middle to late game is cuz pierce resistance
Ecthelion: bfme2 removed shields from all pikes
Ecthelion: yet made em stronger to arrows than metal made soldiers with bigass shields
Valheru: so why dont we fix that and buff pierce HA soldier
Valheru: i thought we nerferd pikes
Ecthelion: we did for heavy armor
Ecthelion: not vs pierce tho
Valheru: wat about crush HA, does it even do anythng
Ecthelion: to pikes?
Valheru: i mean say, gob warrior with HA getting crushed by cav
Ecthelion: ahh
Valheru: still one-hit?
Ecthelion: na
Ecthelion: and rip ur cav
Ecthelion: if unupgraded
Valheru: is it just mens SoG thats shit on ha?
Ecthelion: only men have all HA with a 120% damage scalar
Ecthelion: for a reason i will never know
Ecthelion: i can only think of eomer acting already as a heavy armor for rohirrim
Valheru: interesting
Valheru: just makes men heroes even more orefferable
Valheru: *p
Ecthelion: towerguard unupgraded
Ecthelion:   Armor = SPECIALIST      100%   ;
Ecthelion: heavy armor
Ecthelion:     Armor = SPECIALIST          50% ;
Ecthelion: + 120% dmg scalar
Ecthelion: = 60%
Ecthelion: uruk pikemen
Ecthelion: 100% specialist armor
Ecthelion: heavy armor with damage scalar = 35%
Ecthelion: xD
Valheru: hmm easy for men to have leadership tho
Valheru: wat i dont like is that forged blades instantly makes ur base so vunerable
Ecthelion: not under the super constant debuff since 1.07
Ecthelion: also
Valheru: the warg and isen pike blades too high dmg
Ecthelion: i still want to convert all 50% armor leaderships to 35
Valheru: idk yet, well takl about it soon
Valheru: i gota go out for an hour
Valheru: dont close this chat til uve done the shit we spoike of
Ecthelion: just think that 50% armor + def stance = glorious charge
Ecthelion: xd
Ecthelion: i save chats


Valheru: its fine but revenge needs to go up a bit, and I would also filter muma attack to slightly lower radius vs phalnx
Valheru: bcoz ur entire horde is dead in 2 hits
Valheru: dont be too heavy tho coz this game be diffrnt with other pp path
Ecthelion: this bad pp path actually allowed me to survive longer
Ecthelion: 3 balrogs
Valheru: yes and made Mordor survive longer which u cant handle late game
Ecthelion: what do you think of creating new damage nuggets
Ecthelion: in crush revenge weapons of pikemen
Ecthelion: that get enabled by forged blades?
Valheru: wats the point tho, just mumakil r effected
Valheru: revenge kils everything else
Ecthelion: lel
Ecthelion: not really
Ecthelion: knights can crush thru pikes
Ecthelion: highranked wargs with bats too
Ecthelion: that's basicaly my new tactics
Ecthelion: crush pikes =D
Valheru: i think its gay idea, makes pike spam eveen more dominant and host adv more decisive
Valheru: these flaming shots are shit to mumakil to u should buff that
Valheru: bout 15%
Ecthelion: u mean even more damage than they did?
Ecthelion: i was pretty happy with them
Ecthelion: just suffered to pay 400 every time
Valheru: 7-8 hits
Valheru: 15% more to muma on flaming yeh
Ecthelion: or, thinking lazzy
Ecthelion: muma cud take bit more flame dmg
Ecthelion: fire arrows are not instant counter like bfme1
Ecthelion: with nazguls crushing and debuffing around
Valheru: this is dworf specific.
Valheru: jus roll the changes as we talk
Valheru: also this fkn catapult move speed is shit as
Valheru: *dworf one
Valheru: how boput check their level gains too
Ecthelion: i don't either mind catapults slow, but they deserve more dmg than giants tbh
Ecthelion: tooltip mocks they show 2 projectiles at once
Ecthelion: *shoot
Ecthelion: but dmg is inferior to trebuchets, giants, treebeard etc
Valheru: yeh its bad
Valheru: fix that
Valheru: id give it a few more speed tho
Ecthelion: also what do you think of flaming stones
Ecthelion: does not actually mean more dmg to fortrewss?
Ecthelion: same for trebuchets
Ecthelion: it just add flame nuggets which walls and fortress are inmune or take 1%
Valheru: the dmg is not that good tho anyway
Valheru: also should give muma trample bit less to dworf hero
Ecthelion: basically a useless but good looking upgrade
Valheru: have u coded anything?
Ecthelion: ye
Valheru: can u plz code citadel to give money
Valheru: i hate this power
Valheru: and prepare a weapon file and we'll test all the muma shit sometime



Valheru: not a fan of 50% on heroes
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea i think i mentioned you
Aulë|Ecthelion: i would like to convert all 50% leaderships on 33%
Aulë|Ecthelion: or 35 or something like that
Aulë|Ecthelion: anyways
Aulë|Ecthelion: thing is, if i take upgrades vs isen
Aulë|Ecthelion: saruman will still one-hit my shits
Aulë|Ecthelion: heros are too much better than upgrades, and this is from ur design of 1.7 tbh. Heros stronger
Valheru: we're getting there, at least we did a lot of upgrade accesibility stuff
Valheru: i like thr forge changes
Aulë|Ecthelion: yes that was excelent
Aulë|Ecthelion: men upgrades are lovely
Aulë|Ecthelion: but...
Aulë|Ecthelion: men heavy armor is nerfed since 1.05
Aulë|Ecthelion: while isen pike HA is improved by a damage scalar of 70, men HAs are nerfed by one of 120
Valheru: i thought u did some men stuff in 109
Aulë|Ecthelion: i did at first but it meant nothing
Aulë|Ecthelion: they had the damage scalars twice and i removed one
Aulë|Ecthelion: but game had never readed the two damage scalars anyways
Aulë|Ecthelion: i figured out too late and i didn't dare to buff at that stage of beta
Valheru: oh
Aulë|Ecthelion: maybe... if blacksmith was even cheaper
Aulë|Ecthelion: and heavy armor was on level 1
Aulë|Ecthelion: like with eregion forge
Aulë|Ecthelion: there would be no need to buff the stats
Valheru: is it shit on rohs?
Aulë|Ecthelion: alone ye
Aulë|Ecthelion: but rohirrims are usually with eomer leadership
Aulë|Ecthelion: which is basicaly a better heavy armor
Valheru: gay system
Aulë|Ecthelion: but if eomer was 33%
Aulë|Ecthelion: and upgrades were trully 50%
Aulë|Ecthelion: that would be the same
Aulë|Ecthelion: vs factions without debuff
Valheru: do that if u want, throw himo exp if he doesnt have it
Valheru: i gna play game of dota
Aulë|Ecthelion: that game still exists'
Valheru: ye very rarely play
Valheru: u cunts taking all my time with playing bfme
Valheru: lol
Aulë|Ecthelion: when are you gonna unnistall that garbage bra
Valheru: bra i seeing some big atak trol reps
Valheru: val proud
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea they are pretty fine
Aulë|Ecthelion: but MT are better, and you finally saw it i think
Aulë|Ecthelion: u got rektd by them
Valheru: that pisd me off lol, had nothin in base, game was won
Aulë|Ecthelion: lel
Aulë|Ecthelion: trollcage armor is also farm armor
Aulë|Ecthelion: that's why pikes can't counter it
Aulë|Ecthelion: 4 SH trollcage is basicaly a perfect opening
Valheru: but is it psychological, are ppl actually tring with swords>? probs dont know
Aulë|Ecthelion: u can't try with swords
Aulë|Ecthelion: because you get crushed, that simple
Aulë|Ecthelion: lel
Aulë|Ecthelion: and the little orc boys in the mordor barricades really like cavalry
Aulë|Ecthelion: but don't worry i just learnt this, next time i will pike+sword glute ;)
Valheru: i like where we have all troll types atm, fuk im amazing
Valheru: dnt wori about cage bra, the crush nerfs is enuf
Aulë|Ecthelion: drummers not so popular
Valheru: i think thats a knowledge thing tho
Valheru: i seen glute n ryan use
Valheru: kep em close to other trol
Aulë|Ecthelion: ah btw
Aulë|Ecthelion: i wanted to send you replays
Aulë|Ecthelion: i prepared a "lame for val" folder
Aulë|Ecthelion: did i send you that already?
Valheru: preti sure i watched em all, check facebook msg date
Aulë|Ecthelion: did you find trolls and ling action?
Valheru: i cant remember hoinestly my medication rly shits on my memory
Valheru: lings seem fine tho?
Valheru: i havent seen any real abuse
Aulë|Ecthelion: ok lel
Aulë|Ecthelion: will later chek reps
Aulë|Ecthelion: well, they are definetively lame in big maps
Aulë|Ecthelion: because you can't punish inmediatly
Valheru: one of those units thats either broken or shit, but i think we prety close to perfect
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea not perfect definetively
Aulë|Ecthelion: but i think we already nerfed them a bit on actual beta
Valheru: 2 much iu th ink i did
Valheru: * i think
Valheru: i dnt think pierce is the problem after playing a bit
Aulë|Ecthelion: nah, that's a fine measure
Aulë|Ecthelion: but what i consider a extrem nerf is lurtz
Aulë|Ecthelion: like i said yesterday
Aulë|Ecthelion: Elves vs Isen is actually balanced if it wasn't because of devastation+saruman combos
Aulë|Ecthelion: Isen vs Gob also pretty balanced on 1.09, althought requires a very agressive gameplay
Aulë|Ecthelion: i don't even see the point of nerfing even more against specific shelob
Aulë|Ecthelion: Gandy survives lurtz cripple, but ofc some nerf is more than welcome

											if
												options 1 and 2.

											men elf			Gondor soldiers shields now yes can be strenghted without become op on Land. All men units stop being Wood dependent. HA penalties can be gone.
											men dwarf		Good game dynamics for both factions. Wood less op early game Gimli less op middle game.
											men isen		Lone towers can have a purpose now if debuff drives me crazy. I WOULD LIKE THEODEN became one of this new Stacky spell leaderships.
											men gob			Good for gobs. And if we give men a Stacky Spell
											men mordor		Good for mordor. MEN NEEDS A STACKY SPELL. BOROMIR / THEODEN BEING THE SAME IS BAD.
											elf dwarf		 Good. Tier 2 elf wood should have any kind of compensation...
											elf isen		Arwen now yes can be properly effective with lancers. Good. Tier 2 elf wood should have any kind of compensation...
											elf gob				No more bullshit of SR in defensive stance with land crushing pikes. SR pike armor can be slightly restored to pikes again. Arwen now yes can be properly effective with lancers.
											elf mordor			Elf suffer too much from taint land. Not anymore, but only this mu worries me. ORCS CAN BE BUFFED AGAIN THO
											dwarf isen			I have chances vs debuff with wagon+dain, and gimli is less necesary. Happy.
											dwarf mordor		Orcs in defensive stance with land have always been a pain in the ass for early game. Gimli armor nerfed so also good here.
											dwarf gob			If debuff drives me cracy i can get Dain+Wagon stacking. Excelent. Also gimli less OP which is welcomed by all match ups.
											isen vs gob			Promotes gorkil vs isen, which is not usual. Taint land irrelevant here.
											isen vs mordor		Taint land less op, promotes eye. I like this.
											mordor vs gob		I like goblin now have a leadership to survive naz debuff.
