the following is a chat i still haven't read.




SilverBane`: you know whats cancer?
SilverBane`: lurtz pin duration and isengard overall
SilverBane`: 15s is a joke, especially with new delay on carnage
SilverBane`: and that would be fine but pin has a long ass cooldown too now
SilverBane`: and you'll keep saying its fine, release the patch, and then after 2 years realise me and other bois were right after all. just like it happened with motw on 1.09
THE_ECTH4NG3L: "Taints an area of terrain \n Enemies inside are randomly damaged and debuffed. \n Weak heart enemies are frightened.\n Left click icon then left click on target area"
THE_ECTH4NG3L: better than nothing!
SilverBane`: also wargs always feel like suicide bombers... trample but die. i hate wargs
SilverBane`: they take so much damage
SilverBane`: from everything
SilverBane`: bws are in good spot now though
THE_ECTH4NG3L: that's the cost of being the cheapest cav of the game
SilverBane`: cheapest as in building included
SilverBane`: cuz lancers are better than wargs
SilverBane`: for RB rushing
SilverBane`: and id dare to say even vs units when theres no heavy trample dmg required (eg vs dwarf)
SilverBane`: naz is broken onhost and useless offhost (if shitty host especially)
THE_ECTH4NG3L: im happy with warg heavy armor buff against magic and fire
SilverBane`: spiderriders kinda the same
SilverBane`: warg need a splash buff
SilverBane`: swords rape them too hard
SilverBane`: slash*
SilverBane`: especially vs gobs, even if you try to run only in flanks, when theres delay gob warriors slow u down and rape even without poison
SilverBane`: or maybe flank damage reduction
SilverBane`: for warg
SilverBane`: armor
SilverBane`: also the formation offsets or idk what
SilverBane`: makes half troll 1 single unit rape half warg horde in 1 hit
SilverBane`: maybe a bit more spacing
SilverBane`: between warg bois
SilverBane`: in horde
SilverBane`: or remove the "randomness"factor
SilverBane`: in offset
SilverBane`: isengard is evil elves anyways
SilverBane`: but all in all
SilverBane`: isen is too weak
SilverBane`: needs a buff somewhere
SilverBane`: maybe cheaper lumbercamps idk
SilverBane`: and is also the most boring faction ingame
SilverBane`: because evil elves design
SilverBane`: they are too elite
SilverBane`: for evil faction
SilverBane`: currently lumber camps are only worth to build if you already have advantage over the enemy
SilverBane`: cuz they build too slow and are more expensive + produce less income
SilverBane`: also i never pick palantir because theres always a dwarf when i do it. palantir vs dwarf means gg
SilverBane`: maybe switch up a bit the spells
SilverBane`: pala with crows, or wildmen with devastation/industry
SilverBane`: pala/fuel the fires path is used like 3-5% of times
SilverBane`: crow/devastation is too fukin good
SilverBane`: with watcher
SilverBane`: and thats not specific to isen either. the spellbooks atm all have 1 dominant line and 1 nearly useless path
SilverBane`: like how many times do we still see mordor warchant, or even land lately =)
SilverBane`: eye is OP, land useless
SilverBane`: warchant useless
SilverBane`: only good with cors but eye is better
THE_ECTH4NG3L: bemis im bagina :D:D
SilverBane`: and with gobs going land/chant is like 10% of games in certain MUs, cuz otherwise u gonna be rekt by land or rallying called units, or u wont be able to trample buffed elf units
SilverBane`: so bats is picked for safety
SilverBane`: and then wilds is much better than investing in a hugely risky tree (chant/land/scav)
SilverBane`: cuz earlier watcher
SilverBane`: to win the game
SilverBane`: hobbits are too good compared to other men spells
SilverBane`: only bombadil decent
SilverBane`: for 10pp
SilverBane`: dwarf is fine
SilverBane`: and elf ents are not so popular but mist is good vs heros
SilverBane`: farsight still much more used
SilverBane`: the onyl reason dwarf tree is fine is because riches allow u to get fast OP heros
SilverBane`: and people still abandon that path and go to RC path anyways after getting riches
THE_ECTH4NG3L: GranThorino: he only allows 'friends' to join :D  GranThorino: also I will need a link
<< Host disabled Friends-Only >>
SilverBane`: i just told you a ton of stuff that could be changed. what have you to say
SilverBane`: apart from the retarded penis in vagina
SilverBane`: if a change is bad it can be reverted, thats why its a fucking beta version
SilverBane`: if you're not even willing to try then why bother
SilverBane`: its retarded as fuck that gobs, that are not related to wildmen at all use the spell every single time
SilverBane`: but isengard, who was the wildmen overseer
SilverBane`: sees the spell being used maybe 3% of games
SilverBane`: gobs shouldnt even have that spell tbh, same like dragons for isengard is retarded
<< GranThorino joined the room >>
GranThorino: well well
SilverBane`: also ur beta testing is useless because theres no place where testers can write their feedback
SilverBane`: and the only thing thats being done is replays watched by val and doing his own subjective changes (like faster cave trolls vs elves)
SilverBane`: like literally everyone who saw that
SilverBane`: was against it
SilverBane`: but val did it anyways

"mordor without MoS struggling to deal with cavetroll spam." by silvercancer.






-Mountain troll ideas: reduce speed and use ChargeSpeed bonuses, like BFME1 trolls or BarrowWights.



 HSLegolasArrowWind can u keep this icon blueish????????'

 
-make builders not lowlod. It's unfair low lod player see a generic builder model.

 

-otto silver asking for lightning nerf. some number between 1.09 and current. I agree for dwarf only. Ara's got double heal and blademaster, gimli's got nothing.

	 -Argonath. remove outposts on argonath or use the lings to defend em.

	 ;Valheru: anfalas is good but it needs neutral lairs next to outpost/signal

	E: maybe i get silver to add something in the 4 corners of the map

	 Valheru: harad is fine but instead of 2 goblin lairs near outposts, just put 1 right next to it. The lairs are too close to base, awful for FoD

	SilverNoob map review
		woody end - maybe some fix on cliff textures, but alright
		wilderland - X - bad map, outpost abuse and nub textures
		slopes of ered engrin - X - texture choice is awful for grass/cliff area, and layout looks pretty dumb. id remove it
 		 river of orodruin - looks pretty nice
		rhun shore - might be alright
		rhovanion steppes - beautiful
 		 raven pass - looks alright except cliffs. noob cliffs
		paths of dead - i love it! but i smell noob gameplay cuz too narrow. X
		nan elmoth - X - nub ugly map, also kinda narrow
 		mirkwood forest - X imo - literally gay, pink ambient color and gey design
		midgewater - thyrn gorthad 2.0 its ok i guess
		lamedon - beautiful! i actually like this one (except top cliff textures) for 4v4
		ironhills 2,3,4 - X imo - sucky gameplay and gay design
 		gundabad pass - big X - nub map
		fords of rohan - we played it. nice texture, dumb name and side fords too narrow
		fords of harnen - i played this one in rotwk. i like it, and rlly beautiful textures
 		ered luin valley - :OOOOO never seen a map with those textures outside campaign. but i guess its kinda narrow and retarded
		erech 2 - i like textures alot, but dumb layout. narrower middle and NOOB cliffs (stretched texture on cliffs)
		emyn arnen ffa - beautiful but tall cliffs with grass texture looks kinda dumb. wouldnt mind tho
 		druwaith reef - looks strange but its ok i guess
		dorwinion - beautiful but huge for 1v1. also, i hate rock texture in the city. id say X but its beautiful otherwise
		dessert of rhun - X nub map. i played this many times in rotwk, nub retarded 4v4 map where 1 player is highground and super protected
		coast of nurnen - X - cheap copy of my sea of nurn, with ugly textures and ruin placement, also incredibly small farmspace for teams
 		canyons of khand - we played it today. dont like the cliffs/highrounds/towers/chokepoints, camera is jerky. id say X
 		blackroot vale - X - ugly confusing green everywhere (not even paths) and ugly large river in mid. only waterfall unplayable side is beauiful
		 

	Valheru: Westmarch is a good size but theres outposts right next to base. Move them somewhere futher away and add warg lairs

	Valheru: Sea of nurnen stunning
	Valheru: but fix uncontested outposts

	 -jungles of harad lighting


	Valheru: westmarch is alrite but everyone starts with an Inn(no creep)
	Valheru: yeh its a decent shape and stuff, terrains alrite, but not much happening. can u just put a warg or goblin lair in place of inns?

		 
	 
	-to silver: can you add something on the middle of Tumladen?

;;-------------------------Ecth.Notes----------------------;;
	-DESIGN: lancers on isen might be op
	-DESIGN: spiderlings vs gobs broken. scalar looks bad for 1v1
	-DESIGN: Drogoth stuff
		radius of dmg still gay. I still ask for a dmg nerf compensated with a penalty from Elves and Men. 
		Drogoth has too high damage. It always one hits anytthing and the shockwave feels like twice bigger than other flyers because he always use the Plow weapon (other flyers use GrabWeapon 70% of times)
		He deals more than 2 witchking maze hits per attack.
		If you don't like the idea of  allowing the survivor damage him while he's moving, at least allow heavy armor pikes to survive his attacks.
	-MODELS: can u make a dying state for wagon Goat? atm u see a rino die.
  	-ICONS: saruman dominate icon is dumb. looks like some soul stealing thing. - 
		Yes idiot, because thats exactly what dominate does.
			;na, thats fanciful and gay like warcraft! even in the movie it's just a influence.
	-INFO.You know that abusing of Scale = X thing you just fuck up selection boxes & nuggets right? (select boxes dont change, nuggets do). (Drogoth healing looks too big)
 	-QUESTION: I have the fix for dwarf heavy armor. They needed a production update module. Do you still want to make single purchase tiny upgrades, so the armor can be stronger!
	-QUESTION: In rohan banner and knight banner there's a showsubobject module triggered by Upgrade_DwarvenMithrilMail, which is not granted anywhere. Does this mean u had an HD model for mounted banners which is not showing up?
	-ICONS: the Only icon that has sucked bad since the beggining of bfme1 is boromir Train Allies and you still haven't fixed that.
	-ICONS: I think dain's Train allies icon will work as leadership icon for both dain and gimli. 
 	-ICONS: saruman dominate icon is dumb. looks like some soul stealing thing.
		;Yes idiot, because thats exactly what dominate does.
			na, thats fanciful and gay like warcraft! even in the movie it's just a influence.
	-ICONS: make saruman blast icon more purple instead of blue. check its FX!
	-ICONS: grima icons are cancer
	-MODELS.fortress eagle needs unique skin to distinguish from summones
	-MODELS. that tree model with treebeard legs is shit. 
	-MODELS. make a easterling model with larger pike... and less shitty.
 	-MODELS. HARD TO distinguish GONDOR ARCHER FORM SOLDIER. BANNER CARRIERS WITH SHIELD BAD IDEA. both models are also a bit too grey i think.
	-MODELS. level 2 & level 3 isen floors are barely differencibla. I MISS ORANGE WITH ALL MY HEART
	-FXS: watcher lags me. (when two watchers on screen)
	-FXS: sunflare lags me too  
	-FXS: SUNFLARE LOOKS STUPID IF NO FX TOUCHES THE GROUND. 
	-FXS: sunflare lags when used on big armies. it's like u overwhelm the particle buffer to the point game doesn't even show the Burning death fxs.
	-FXS: RC double fx sucks. looks like a kid combining colors in a palette 
	-FXS: can u make mumakil nugget slightly smaller?
	-FXS: gandalf wop made glute crahs
	-FXS: Can you make farsight4 sound shorter?
	-FXS. Make eowyn spear thrown slightly different than eomers. Like more gold than eomers.
  	-FXS. We still having the bug of game confusing BuffNugggets, can u delete some? Both Athelas spells can be pure particlesystem. 
		FX_AragornAthBTP
		FX_ElrondAth is beautiful but im sure u can make a particle like these you added on this beta.
		FX_ElrondHealSpecialPower can be a fx. no need to be a nugget of 5secs for 1 power.
		FX_GenericDebuff25Grima absolutely unnecesary. 
	-FXS: Horde Respawn needs to be differenced from Fortress/Well respawn again. Perhaps a rainbow is not a big deal considering it's 2 colors per faction.
	-FXS. MakeDoubt FX purple instead of black/wine? match with icon and debuff nugget. 
		- OK I WILL
	-FXS: Make DISSENT FX morgul green? and a new icon with a green like the old one?!?!?!?!?!!?!? epik
	-FXS: Linear FX for gloin slam? some craks on the ground that make sense regard the hammer animation..
	-FXS: wk mounted death fx is playing in dismounted wk, unless u intentionaly wanted floating shit.
 	-FXS: Gloin EQ is synchronized like shit.
	-FXS: nobody liking mystic fountain piss
	-FXS: is it me or RC fx is ruined with these metalic white fxs?
	-DESIGN: can we nerf Flyers plow weapon to avoid one hiting strong units inside tunnel.
 	-DESIGN: poison arrow dmg bonus vs heroes
	-DESIGN: shelob still way too effective to counter ur beloeved trolls - OK NERF HER VS TROLL
 	-DESIGN: RC TO 35% EXP?
 	-BOXES: mordor catapult select box too big
	-BOXES: rivendel lancer banner select box is bigger than the horde itself. it's kinda annoying when you are trying to aim the lvl 1 horde, in case it's a group of 2-3lancers.
	-BOXES: Fellbeast & WK mounted select box too big! fix fix fix! It's due the wings. eagle&drogoth dont't have select box in wings. - having weird issues trying to fix this
	-BOXES: thranduil select box annoying
  		
;;------------------------Val.Notes--------------------;;

 -saruman levels 5-8 exp required needs to go up a little bit
 		-Beserkers need a new model entirely.
 		- wagon heal could be a tiny bit higher 
			;tbh i only care they survive something in level 1 when crushing. You need 2-3 wagon to crush a highranked bunch of archers with leadership and ANY kind of heroe near. Wagons are op once you have a group of 4-5 highranked ones.
		- wagons Heavy Armor upgrade? 
			;would be unfair if spider rider didn't have it. but that would be gey modding already.
		- Knights levels 1-3 exp.
			;wat about that? u want more or less? 
		-lots of spells look awful at 460 zoom or whatever it is. I designed them all on 560 height
			;i would keep insisting with 450 zooms tbh.
		-val notes from reps: The trail fx bit too bright too
		-FXS: banner carrier fx doesnt occur when upgrading new wagon model. ez fix do it tomorrow.
			

		
		
;;------------------------Balance.Theory------------------------;;
 			- RC 120s CD
			- Land lasts 270s
			-Land CD is 270s
			-Land Penalty 15% armor
			-Crebain/bats 150s CD, 50s duration
 			;Elves vs Men
				//EcthThoughts//: Gondor soldiers shields now yes can be strenghted without become op on Land. All men units stop being Wood dependent. HA penalties can be gone. Faramir / Eomer will be in a nasty position, but Legolas Thranduil ranged damage can be reduced into the average of 1.06 and 1.09 values.
 				-Men wood cooldown buffed
				-Men Wood duration buffed
				-Men wood radius buffed
				-Men wood lost 15% armor
				-The real effects of the wood buffs dont really kick in til after the first recharge. Area buff is tiny, and the lifetime buff is only noticeable at the end of the first spell. So the hardest part of the 15% armor loss for men is the first 4 minutes of the game.
				-Since these first 4 minutes are often the most important, Men will require scalars on elven weapons, small numbers.
				-SoG have 5% shield wall buff but this is not immediately applicable 
  			;Men vs Mordor
				//EcthThoughts//: Good for mordor. MEN NEEDS A STACKY SPELL. BOROMIR / THEODEN BEING THE SAME IS BAD.
 				- I dont think any changes are neccesary here until proper beta happens. Both factions have buffs that are outside of the land armor nerfs
 			;Men vs Dwarves
 				//EcthThoughts//: Good game dynamics for both factions. Wood less op early game Gimli less op middle game. Hero spam not so unstoppeable, warf army not so unstoppeable.
 				- Land nerfs hurt men here, but SoG got bonus to dwarf mines, shield wall buff, and SoG specialist buff(easier creep jacks). I would take an educated guess that Guardians will need a small nerf to SoG/TG/GA
 			;Men vs Isengard
				//EcthThoughts//: Lone towers can have a purpose now if debuff drives me crazy. I WOULD LIKE THEODEN became one of this new Stacky spell leaderships.
 				- Crebain 10s less lifetime, and usually negates Mens land the first time round. Other land buffs will help a lot here. Warg nerfs, shield wall buff, Uruk Hai block nerf and nerf to farm. Not changing anything til beta happens
 			;Men Vs Goblins
 				- Both got same land changes, but gobs usually take bats and men land. Shield wall buff useful here
				//EcthThoughts//: Good for gobs. And if we give men a Stacky Spell
 			;Mordor vs Isengard
				//EcthThoughts//: Taint land less op, promotes eye. I like this.
 				- No changes neccesary upfront as both factions have buffs/nerfs outside of taint land armor nerf. Plus eye/wc is common
 			;Mordor vs Elves
				//EcthThoughts//: Elf suffer too much from taint land. Not anymore, but only this mu worries me. ORCS CAN BE BUFFED AGAIN THO
 				- Land armor nerf hurts here. Hordebonus was buffed though to pierce. But LA will require scalars to Orc Warriors mostly, perhaps a tiny bit to orc archers.
 			;Mordor vs Dwarves
				//EcthThoughts//: Orcs in defensive stance with land have always been a pain in the ass for early game. Gimli armor nerfed so also good here.
 				- Land armor nerf wont affect it much as taking land vs dwarves sucks dick
 			;Mordor vs Goblins
				//EcthThoughts//: I like goblin now have a leadership to survive naz debuff. 
 				- no changes neccesary upfront
 			;Goblins vs Dwarves
 				- taint land sucks dick vs Dwarves, no changes needed upfront
				//EcthThoughts//: If debuff drives me cracy i can get Dain+Wagon stacking. Excelent. Also gimli less OP which is welcomed by all match ups.
 			;Goblins vs Elves
 				- no changes needed upfront
				//EcthThoughts//: No more bullshit of SR in defensive stance with land crushing pikes. SR pike armor can be slightly restored to pikes again. Arwen now yes can be properly effective with lancers.
 			;Goblins vs Isengard
				//EcthThoughts//: Promotes gorkil vs isen, which is not usual. Taint land irrelevant here.
 				- Land pretty uncommon as 1st power, plus uruks got nerfed so did wargs, no changes needed. If anything, Isengard might need help in this mu.
			;Elves vs Dwarves
 				//EcthThoughts//: Good. Tier 2 elf wood should have any kind of compensation...
			;Elves vs Isengard 
 				//EcthThoughts//: Arwen now yes can be properly effective with lancers. Good. Tier 2 elf wood should have any kind of compensation...<
			;Dwarves vs Isengard
				//EcthThoughts//: I have chances vs debuff with wagon+dain, and gimli is less necesary. Happy.

 	-eowyn shielmaiden is bhaving no sound
	;;Looks like a piece of shit;; - citadels allow heroe revival. commandset looks ugly with the evacuate buttons, maybe i make dwarven halls with more hp and faster buildtime.


 	-fijarse que nadie use ALL PLAYER UPGRADE para un behavior de balance
	could be cause de oos. probblemente ya lo pense pero en map.ini le estoy dando uso, maybe in 08 too.
	-make USAR MUMAKIL_BUFF_NUGGET
	-TROLL_BUFF_NUGGET
	-move sharku man eater. or do something about convert power. Needs attention.

	//----------------------------------//
	-human heads need some kind of filyer vs ents/mumakils. AND EVEN SHELOB.
	-smite better vs trolls.
	-Command_ToggleCatapultWeapon; test if OK_FOR_MULTI_SELECT works.
	-Fixed Mountain giant throwing rocks animation. (No longer new rocks fall from the sky, instead grab them from the ground)
		-ACTUALLY I COULD ONLY FIX NORMAL WEAPON, BUT BOMBARD WEAPON ANIMATION/REAL WEAPON BECOMES WORSE	
	-I test later if upgraded condition is actually read. The code has always been there but BannerHeavyArmor did not exists in armor.ini lel. 
		-Doesn work. I anote later.
 	-pippin merry don't actually shoot in treebeard. even if i put them in rockmode.
	-https://www.gamereplays.org/community/index.php?showtopic=1010078&pid=10115134&st=0&#entry10115134
	-ai for ring heross
	-Crossbow OP vs FoL. 
 	-soldiers still suck, pierce might still needing to go 140% from 150%. (1.6 they took 125%). 
		-Depends on if we change leaderships.
	-soldiers in block formation could have a 315 FrontAngle, so only 45º from behind are one-hiteables.
		-Depends on if we change leaderships.
	-troll cage floor in level 1 looks upgraded when it's not. can't tell if level 1 or level 2 i think.
 	-Drogoth* autoheal nugget looks too bad. I think it's because your lazzy scale in it's object.
