DS lags a bit. 20 fps in lowest. And fire spawn doesnt rlly match at the end. In fact it should stop damaging at the end.
				10 fps in high details
Ds needs to hurt fortress more if casted exactly above (at least to change the damaged model condition). The other dragon can do the barrack-destroy function. 
;;-------------------------;;




;;;-Fixed Mountain giant throwing rocks animation. (No longer new rocks fall from the sky, instead grab them from the ground)
			ACTUALLY I COULD ONLY FIX NORMAL WEAPON, BUT BOMBARD WEAPON ANIMATION/REAL WEAPON BECOMES WORSE----CAN U CHEK IT-----------//


whatever u changed with lod all it does is put my texture level of detail in maximun when i click lowest. Useless. revert blz

HC for muma? it's such a big object, how cant u make one

Val random comments;;;;;;;;;

-Grima hero slow needs to be reduced, the lifetime
-Beserkers need a new model entirely.
-Flyers knockback to tier 1 heroes needs to happen 66% of the time, 2/3rds. And things like Slayer knockback to Tier 1 should happen 80% of the time.
-Bombadil needs about 5% further penalty to mumas
-Nerf muma to phalanx
-silverthorn rapes summon dragon too much

;;------------revise-------------;;
-Wildman now take 85% slash, from 100%

Ech wildman is always going to be an issue because it can be summoned on top of archers. Wildman fucking suck against swordsman, u raging for nothing in that regard, worst armorset. Yet here you are not mentioning Bombadil being unkillable, one punch =half a horde, shout, and retardedly high leadership which was unneccesary.
If you really want to impact wildman properly then a futher OCL EGG delay is neccesary. Something like 1s more. That allows a bit more time to scatter command. Slash buff is fuckall and not the core of the problem.

For the record Axe Throwers suck massive dicks against all swordsmen, not just Wildman. Pretty sure one guardian beats 3 axe throwers. So ur point about wildman vs AT doesnt mean shit.

;;-------------------------;;



;-test

 ;;-;; About Mordor Orc Archer horde bonus. Lets just leave it, theres no point adjusting this shit because if your leadership changes go through its likely we are going to have to reassess everything.

 
 
 /----------------------------------------------------------//

I test later if upgraded condition is actually read. The code has always been there but BannerHeavyArmor did not exists in armor.ini lel. doesnt work. keep trying after psicology work

Doesn't work. I anote later.

/----------------------------------------------------------//




-In rohan banner and knight banner there's a showsubobject module triggered by Upgrade_DwarvenMithrilMail, which is not granted anywhere. Does this mean u had an HD model for mounted banners which is not showing up?
-nerf gandy armor or armorset during lightning . somehow?
-DS still too sad vs fortress. Dont know vs raxs

	-eomer could be 35% armor and heavy armor for cavalry better. heavy armor could be acceisbler also
	-sunflare suck. overnerfed. ;why? doesn't kill upgraded units with leadership. Could be bigger and damage constant during all the FX.
	-pippin merry don't actually shoot in treebeard. even if i put them in rockmode.
	-https://www.gamereplays.org/community/index.php?showtopic=1010078&pid=10115134&st=0&#entry10115134
	-ai for ring heross
	-Crossbow OP vs FoL. 
		//-------------------;; 
	-soldiers still suck, pierce might still needing to go 140% from 150%. (1.6 they took 125%)
	-soldiers in block formation could have a 315 FrontAngle, so only 45º from behind are one-hiteables.
		//--------------------;;		
	-Reconsider making 50% armor leaderships (gimli-eomer-wood-taint-drummer-faramir-dwarf statue-gorkil skull) to go 35% Gimli+Dain + Heavy armor  makes dwarf units kinda inmune to 1.09 flood/Sunflare. With your nerfs, elves without thranduil killing dain will suffer around the same or more than in 1.06.

											men elf			Gondor soldiers shields now yes can be strenghted without become op on Land. All men units stop being Wood dependent. HA penalties can be gone.

											men isen		Lone towers can have a purpose now if debuff drives me crazy. I WOULD LIKE THEODEN became one of this new Stacky spell leaderships.
											men gob			Good for gobs. And if we give men a Stacky Spell
											men mordor		Good for mordor. MEN NEEDS A STACKY SPELL. BOROMIR / THEODEN BEING THE SAME IS BAD.
											elf dwarf		 Good. Tier 2 elf wood should have any kind of compensation...
											elf isen		Arwen now yes can be properly effective with lancers. Good. Tier 2 elf wood should have any kind of compensation...
											elf gob				No more bullshit of SR in defensive stance with land crushing pikes. SR pike armor can be slightly restored to pikes again. Arwen now yes can be properly effective with lancers.
											elf mordor			Elf suffer too much from taint land. Not anymore, but only this mu worries me. ORCS CAN BE BUFFED AGAIN THO
											dwarf isen			I have chances vs debuff with wagon+dain, and gimli is less necesary. Happy.
											dwarf mordor		Orcs in defensive stance with land have always been a pain in the ass for early game. Gimli armor nerfed so also good here.
											dwarf gob			If debuff drives me cracy i can get Dain+Wagon stacking. Excelent. Also gimli less OP which is welcomed by all match ups.
											isen vs gob			Promotes gorkil vs isen, which is not usual. Taint land irrelevant here.
											isen vs mordor		Taint land less op, promotes eye. I like this.
											mordor vs gob		I like goblin now have a leadership to survive naz debuff.
