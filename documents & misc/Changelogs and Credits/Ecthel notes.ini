WATCHER IS LAGGY AF.
SAURON TOO.

Notes



		To balance with other cavalry hordes... what if..?
	-BattleWagon autoheal moved to level 2, from level 5. Healing amount now 10 from 38.
	If when wagon gains HP and HealingAmount 10 sucks dick, wagon gain back 	Modifier = AUTO_HEAL 20
	
	
	
	-BattleWagon banner carrier autoheal to 40 from 30?








-Added guardian speed per rankin shit.

	-que se puedan hacer heroes en citadels

	-What are gonna do with PikemenHeavyArmor and TowerGuardHeavyArmor retarded relationship?
	-AT needs bonus vs haldir
	-OK, AcceptDamageAdd seems to ONLY APPLy FOR LEVELING UP. Warchant and shit still affect crush damage.
					;;to fix Changelogs unreadable in text
	-show all caracthers, search \n replace with \r\n. (extended mode)

	-Orc archer spam on horde bonus is too fast.
	-Orc archer have a crush revenge weapon with specialist damage too strong, fine deal if they were slow. But escape from cavalry in fast horde bonus and also hurt them is not cool.
					
					;;Crossbow;;

					;;Gondor Soldier;;
	-men soldier is too weak to pikes.
	-Idea, make shieldwalls stronger than uruk. Like beating them in 1v1. Needs strengh vs arrows and cavalry aswell. Or, just fix the one-hit crush from cavalry. (i know how now)
					;;Uruk hais;;
	-They seriuosly need to lose the 1v1 against guardian.
					;;Banners
	-barrage needs to dont rape banners too. Always whipe whole elf armies, since mithlonds don't survive siege damage as other pikes do.
					;;cloudbreak
	-Can we make it affect mumakils?

	-can we make watcher don't fuckin knockback strong heros? or at least make it also affect self player.
					;;walls
	-increase experience awards from walls.
					;;trolls
	-Mt needs to take more cavalry or sword dmg. and dont fuckin heal so fast
	-increase exp required for mountain troll. make same as AT. They level up destroying farms, thus, faster than attack trolls.
	-troll cage too strong, can we make it strong on level 3 but not level 1? There's no punishment for starting 4 SH 1 trollcage.
;;revise the CP of all INN units.

					;;catapults
	-should be.All artillery machines and Mountain Giants now have +30% range of shroud reveal. ;;/ Not ents due treebeard leadership. (from +17%)
					;;easterlings guys
	RhunHeavyArmor less pierce to take.
	easterlings should be stronger vs magic? they can't survive any kind of blast? nor even saurons.
					;;mountain giants
	-still too op, thousands better (and faster) investment than 3 mordor catapults together.
	-also; Mountain Giant Health 2800 from 4000 was a fake log change.





;;-------------------------------------Chats-----------------------;;



Valheru: and be less heavy on install radius, u halved it. Move it back up a bit
Valheru: *insta kil
Ecthelion: why tho
Ecthelion: i thought you would love that
Valheru: the principal is fine the numbers are not


;Valheru: and plz nerf TB health a little bit, thatl be enuf nerfing with his rock dmg
Ecthelion: giants too!
Ecthelion: they are living treebeards still
Valheru: the problem isnt their survieability its the buildtime
Ecthelion: ye that too
Valheru: unlimited cash lategame
Valheru: just add 5s or so to it
Valheru: or 7
Ecthelion: i 'd say 5 more secs and also less hp
Ecthelion: or just +10 (which in level 3 it means 6.5s)
Valheru: alrite
Valheru: dnt do hp tho as ur also nerfing fissure
Ecthelion: hp necesary anyways, dwarf struggle too much to kill them
Ecthelion: only way to stop them is to intercept them
Ecthelion: they die to crush revenge mostly
Valheru: u dont do a global nerf to fix that
Ecthelion: just a way of speaking
Ecthelion: MT at the moment are pwning against everything
Ecthelion: *MG
Ecthelion: or
Valheru: i dont think its hp related, its getting to them be4 ur fort dies, which is dmg related. So do a buildtime nerf and also nerf DBS by a bit
Ecthelion: oh yes
;Ecthelion: DBS is weird
Ecthelion: they seem to behave faster than ents
Valheru: ye
Ecthelion: that's weird, idk if that happens in 1.6
Ecthelion: u ever touched that?
Valheru: dnot think so, its a fast anim tho definately
Valheru: id guess 3s between rocks?> idk havent checked dbs
Ecthelion: 6 secs
Valheru: so do 7.25? small but it adds up
Valheru: that with buildtime should be alrite
Ecthelion: it's not that ez to change
Ecthelion: it seems to use both DBS and clips
Ecthelion: treebeard also has 6dbs
Ecthelion: but 3s clip
Ecthelion: RohanTreeBeardRockFromThinAir
Ecthelion: GiantRockThrow
Valheru: i dont know ech but wont be hard to test changes

Ecthelion: by the way, is there any particular nostalgia bfme1 map u want
Ecthelion: whose terrain is fuckin shit for bfme2?
Ecthelion: i got pro pro with WB and minimaps
Valheru: dont we have all the good ones? east emnet and shit r good
Valheru: i remember doing a lot of red-build zone fixing
;Ecthelion: we dont have east and west emnet
Ecthelion: their terrain is super messy
Ecthelion: but i plan to rework these 2
Valheru: they were in 1.08?
Ecthelion: ye
Ecthelion: u flattern halifirien
Ecthelion: and lebennin
Ecthelion: bootyful maps
Valheru: i did emnets iirc, but not sure if they were hilly maps
Valheru: might just put one of haldirs maps into nxt patch
Valheru: call it smthing else, we edited anyway
Valheru: that 3v3 one
Valheru: losarnach
Ecthelion: can't t3a bois fuck off yet? haldir is dead
Ecthelion: all these rotwk maps i stole had owners and t3a fags never cared :D
;Valheru: put lossarnach back in, the one I edited, still have it? I think i put on mediafire
Valheru: also how much faster are phalanx to guardians?
Ecthelion: phalanx 45
Ecthelion: guardian 37
Valheru: perfect, I want to do guard speed .75% per level
;Ecthelion: this is your chance to make a beautiful fx
Valheru: also gayboy can u code in guard speed?> I need to do visuals and my free time not that big anymore
Valheru: .75 per level
Valheru: 7.5% at lvl 10, be near phalanx
Valheru: need 8% for phalanx exact
Valheru: so .8% per level
Valheru: then u dont have to micro guards n phalanx at level 10
Valheru: faceroll bra
Ecthelion: we don't know how speed multipliers stack
Ecthelion: damage for example would be 5% of 5% of 5% of 5% of 5%
Ecthelion: not 25%
Valheru: wouldnt speed just be 108% over n over
Valheru: sorry 100.8
Ecthelion: ah
Ecthelion: got the idea
Ecthelion: to avoid the crazy multiplies
Ecthelion: we make it not stack
Ecthelion: so lvl 2 is 0.7
Ecthelion: lvl 3 is 0.9
Valheru: stack with what?
Ecthelion: etc
Ecthelion: with the others
Valheru: idk wot u mean
Ecthelion: max is 7.5%?
Valheru: wtf u talking about
Valheru: .8% per level increase to guardians only.
Ecthelion: in total we need +22%
Ecthelion: if u want to be as phalanx
Valheru: oh
Valheru: fak thats a lot
Ecthelion: poor guardians...
Valheru: ud have to put bigger numbers at 8 9 and 10
Valheru: otherwise erly game gets fukd up
Ecthelion: it would be 2.4% per level
Ecthelion: but maybe they should only gain at lvl 2  5 maybe 7 and 10
Valheru: 2 strong erly game
Valheru: smthing like 1.5 ewarly
Valheru: n higher at high levels
Ecthelion: if it's level per level all it would make is to fuck the army cordination
Ecthelion: maybe at level 5 and level 10
Ecthelion: like with tower guards
Ecthelion: towerguards having +10% bonus at lvl 5 atm
Ecthelion: CaH_BallLightning
Ecthelion: that's a good lightning sound
Ecthelion: not these uglyass saruman fxs
Valheru: wat i mean is
Valheru: .8 at each level
Valheru: but bigger at certain ones
Valheru: like 5, 8, 9, 10
Valheru: or even some slightly hjigher ones at level 3
Valheru: llike 1%
Ecthelion: yes i know what you mean
Ecthelion: but im saying that if i have an army with a lvl 3 guardian, a lvl 1, a lvl 2
Ecthelion: it would be harder to micro
Ecthelion: teorically ofc, 1% in practice is barely noticeable
Ecthelion: but then, if it's not noticeable, it's useless
Valheru: nah, even small differences in leadership make a difference, even if u dont notice
Valheru: we can do just level 5 and 10 if u want, but it depends if u want this to effect from early game or not
Valheru: mostly dworf need help later on, but u still gota level ur units
Valheru: i spose dain thing solves that
Ecthelion: maybe speed leaderships...
Valheru: if u do 5 and 10 tho itd have to be less, like 7.5 each
Valheru: leadship is confined to one area of the map thats why i came up with this insterad
Ecthelion: i wouldn't mind beta testing with slow speeding up per level in real games, but i don't reallly want to begin that yet
Ecthelion: betas cheapens the official patch
Ecthelion: and 09 still blooming
Ecthelion: so we better hipotetize the max possible
Ecthelion: for now
Valheru: the best way to do this is just to simply see how much faster a guardian is at level 5 or 6, with .8 per level
Valheru: i mean, see how much it effects micro or not
Valheru: so 4%
Ecthelion: pushed dain
Valheru: actually
Valheru: wat about bullrush gets bonus's per level instead?
Valheru: better
Valheru: becausr then the speed is controlled
Ecthelion: rotwk boys wanted to make of bullrush
Ecthelion: a click once buff
Ecthelion: like the charge from the custom hero
Valheru: dumb
Ecthelion: bulrush is 10 secs only tho
Ecthelion: and needs target
Ecthelion: kinda useless to buff speed
Valheru: oh 10s :/
Ecthelion: but bullrush improvements are welcome
Ecthelion: i want to make it non fuckin debuffable
Valheru: 2 strong
Ecthelion: because of the armor leadership
Ecthelion: that is 25
Ecthelion: with def stance becomes into a 50, equalying elf wood
Ecthelion: lel
Valheru: gobs will get crushed
Ecthelion: gobs get crushed under bats or not
Ecthelion: bats are killing the speed boast
Ecthelion: and the 25% armor ofc
Valheru: no i mean, their early game wil be even harder against dworf, by far
Valheru: mordor isnt effected as much, isen neither
;Valheru: whilst i remember, can u code in dworf mine armor bonuses
Ecthelion: vs isen i will at least hurt these inmortal uruks for longer time
;Valheru: also make the level 3 drof mine tower better
;Valheru: even give it forged blade axe if u want
Ecthelion: dwarf mines are strong enough tbh
Ecthelion: just too weak to heros and cav due gay armorset
Ecthelion: FoD's farms are stronger
;Valheru: so fix lvl 2 and 3 for that
Ecthelion: ah....
Ecthelion: good
Valheru: other thing is wagons, they become uber shit late game
Valheru: so make level gains better
Valheru: even tiny bit of speed if u want
Valheru: dont do dmg tho, just armor/speed
Ecthelion: level gains are fine
Ecthelion: they just can't level up in lategame
Ecthelion: farm towers kill them
Ecthelion: and nobody feeds infantry once wagons are on the field
Ecthelion: feeds with*
Valheru: well we need a heavy armor purchase set then
Ecthelion: or the ability to crush pikes a bit
Ecthelion: to participate in battles
Ecthelion: and heal like normal cavalry maybe
Ecthelion: kind of frustrating to heal wagons
Valheru: lower the auto heal level?
Ecthelion: while isen crush ur army with pikes
Ecthelion: and send the surviving wargs to excavations
Valheru: if its level 5 drop it to 4
Ecthelion: its 5 ye
Valheru: and buff specialist/structural armor per level
Valheru: or even just 5-10
Valheru: hero ranged too
Valheru: there, wagons fixd
Ecthelion: sounds good
Ecthelion: clumped wargs rape wagons tho
Ecthelion: oh
Ecthelion: btw
Ecthelion: i thought warg howl was 180 on 1.06
Ecthelion: and bt2dc made it 170
Ecthelion: but no...
Ecthelion: it was fuckin 160 on 1.6
Ecthelion: on all btp history warg howl has been giving stronger crush damage
Ecthelion: raping innocent things like guardians, even faster
Valheru: wats 109, 170?
Valheru: 65
Valheru: but i think btp had it on lvl 2 at some point
Ecthelion: 65% 09
Ecthelion: and 155 currently
Ecthelion: for 1.09 i had removed the -15% armor penalty for everything but pikes and structural
Ecthelion: i wouldn't have done that if i knew howl was stronger than vanilla ffs
Valheru: ye well, we didnt know about crush, its gaymode
Ecthelion: it helped vs goblins a lot tho
Ecthelion: since gobs don't give a fuck if howl or not, but people use it to ensure one-hit under bats
Valheru: ye but i hate seeing it against men n guardians
Ecthelion: today i think i one hited a corsair
Valheru: id rather it was level 2 but may throw balance out with mordor n gob
Valheru: bcoz rly even 50% bonus dmg is still gay for level 1
Valheru: and iirc u cant debuff it
Ecthelion: which is fine vs gobs
Ecthelion: since these stupid tunnels are tanky as fuck vs debuffed cavalry
Ecthelion: and marauders one-hitting whole clumped horde
Valheru: we should try 50% for beta and reduce its lifetime
Valheru: i gota go out
Ecthelion: one more thing
Ecthelion: any idea to nerf gandy?
Ecthelion: i say level 5 bonus is the problem
Valheru: its the wiz blast arc which i nerfd hard
Ecthelion:  Modifier = SPELL_DAMAGE 200% // Spell damage doubled   Modifier = RECHARGE_TIME 75% ; ;50%// Spell recharge time halfed (twice as quick to recharge)   Modifier = HEALTH 200
Valheru: the problem is just his blast
Valheru: less radius also slows down the levelling a lot
Ecthelion: i think he would remain op or at least better than other's 5k guys if he still had vanilla blast
Valheru: that arc is pretty heavy herf, lower the recharge on GTW by 10% if u want
Valheru: i dont want gandalf not one-hitting upgraded units if thats wat u want
Ecthelion: why!
Valheru: hes wot makes men l8 game so good
Ecthelion: and also forces the creation of countering hero spam
Ecthelion: thranduil elrond
Ecthelion: grima lurtz saru
Valheru: they all get raped by istari/lw
Valheru: gandy fuks ur units and ur heroes
Ecthelion: hahahaha, so you admit he's annoying af
Ecthelion: op nigger
Valheru: as it should be. dont forget how gay mens slow infantry is late game
Ecthelion: can't we try to make swordmen and general infantry good in lategame? :(
Ecthelion: towerguards are favorite units in lategame now
Valheru: we are, getting there
Valheru: u know, a lot of the problem i see is that tough hero armor is the problem
Valheru: mostly that swordsmen do 0 dmg to it
Ecthelion: tough hero is 3k hero
Ecthelion: he doesnt use that one
Valheru: i know we have a counter system, but its pathetic dmg
Valheru: im talking about elrond aragorn gimli
Ecthelion: bleh, gimli get's raped by swords
Ecthelion: goblin swords at least
Ecthelion: but i guess hat's due poison
Valheru: we should test how many SoG it takes to kill a gimli
Valheru: bcoz i bet its about 9 million
Ecthelion: oh well ye
Ecthelion: without leadesrhip
Ecthelion: and faramir wound arrows taking away 1/3 health bar ye
Valheru: same with lots of pierce
Ecthelion: but instead
Ecthelion: 3 uruks vs gimli
Ecthelion: without use powers
Ecthelion: that might be different
Valheru: uruk not slash right
Valheru: this gay hero armor is a lot of what promotes pike spam late game
Ecthelion: but it's also 25%
Ecthelion: pike spam from middle to late game is cuz pierce resistance
Ecthelion: bfme2 removed shields from all pikes
Ecthelion: yet made em stronger to arrows than metal made soldiers with bigass shields
Valheru: so why dont we fix that and buff pierce HA soldier
Valheru: i thought we nerferd pikes
Ecthelion: we did for heavy armor
Ecthelion: not vs pierce tho
Valheru: wat about crush HA, does it even do anythng
Ecthelion: to pikes?
Valheru: i mean say, gob warrior with HA getting crushed by cav
Ecthelion: ahh
Valheru: still one-hit?
Ecthelion: na
Ecthelion: and rip ur cav
Ecthelion: if unupgraded
Valheru: is it just mens SoG thats shit on ha?
Ecthelion: only men have all HA with a 120% damage scalar
Ecthelion: for a reason i will never know
Ecthelion: i can only think of eomer acting already as a heavy armor for rohirrim
Valheru: interesting
Valheru: just makes men heroes even more orefferable
Valheru: *p
Ecthelion: towerguard unupgraded
Ecthelion:   Armor = SPECIALIST      100%   ;
Ecthelion: heavy armor
Ecthelion:     Armor = SPECIALIST          50% ;
Ecthelion: + 120% dmg scalar
Ecthelion: = 60%
Ecthelion: uruk pikemen
Ecthelion: 100% specialist armor
Ecthelion: heavy armor with damage scalar = 35%
Ecthelion: xD
Valheru: hmm easy for men to have leadership tho
Valheru: wat i dont like is that forged blades instantly makes ur base so vunerable
Ecthelion: not under the super constant debuff since 1.07
Ecthelion: also
Valheru: the warg and isen pike blades too high dmg
Ecthelion: i still want to convert all 50% armor leaderships to 35
Valheru: idk yet, well takl about it soon
Valheru: i gota go out for an hour
Valheru: dont close this chat til uve done the shit we spoike of
Ecthelion: just think that 50% armor + def stance = glorious charge
Ecthelion: xd
Ecthelion: i save chats














































Valheru: u know, this whole crush discovery means ur guna have to eat shit and restore black rider crush adds
Aulë|Ecthelion: i had tested that
Aulë|Ecthelion: and it worked as intended
Aulë|Ecthelion: atm i think AcceptDmgAdd thing only applies for leveling up
Valheru: but, u did it under the assumption that other cav dont get more crush from LD
Aulë|Ecthelion: we forgot to test ranked wargs yesterday
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea that was the paradigma
Valheru: in those 2v2s we played

-Standarize leaderships? Make armor 33 or 33 or 37.5%?

Aulë|Ecthelion: btw
Aulë|Ecthelion: i saw you made another 50% damage leadership bifurcation
Aulë|Ecthelion: for theoden i think
Aulë|Ecthelion: what's the idea behind this bad looking design of stronk theoden with super nerfed gloriuos charge?
Valheru: using words like super for 10% is faggot talk
Valheru: erly game support hero, useless weapon, big suport
Aulë|Ecthelion: but i hate the idea of making leadership complex
Aulë|Ecthelion: for example sibel is making now a video of leadership based with the exact 1.09 leadership sys
Valheru: well, drummer trols is one example
Aulë|Ecthelion: and you add more variations for a 10%
Aulë|Ecthelion: yeah, drummers bad too
Valheru: whos sibel?
Valheru: btw luigi is raging cunt
Aulë|Ecthelion: deathg0d
Aulë|Ecthelion: ah, btw
Aulë|Ecthelion: did you know
Aulë|Ecthelion: sharku saruman and darkness stack?
Aulë|Ecthelion: :D
Valheru: not for long!
Aulë|Ecthelion: 2 years ago i thought only darkness would remain
Aulë|Ecthelion: but all different glowy stars leadership stacks
Valheru: ye goiod
Valheru: btw i thought of stat stuff for level 10 heroes/units
Valheru: to fill in weakness's of races
Valheru: for example u could give gimli a passive talent that gives small speed bonus to units
Valheru: or a passive weapon upg
Valheru: like aoe on standard wep
Valheru: etc
Aulë|Ecthelion: i personaly think that speed or more leaderships won't be necesary (unless they are inmune to debuff)
Aulë|Ecthelion: dwarf needs upgrades more viable
Aulë|Ecthelion: and same applies for Men and elf infantry
Valheru: theres a way to make a power that gives a horde upgrades
Valheru: free
Valheru: anyway its a general idea atm
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea we even have the bfme1 rohan guys fx for that
Aulë|Ecthelion: and the sounds, and everything
Aulë|Ecthelion: but my point is
Aulë|Ecthelion: gimli leadership is better than upgrades vs Elves
Aulë|Ecthelion: but this leadership is pretty useless vs isen
Valheru: not a fan of 50% on heroes
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea i think i mentioned you
Aulë|Ecthelion: i would like to convert all 50% leaderships on 33%
Aulë|Ecthelion: or 35 or something like that
Aulë|Ecthelion: anyways
Aulë|Ecthelion: thing is, if i take upgrades vs isen
Aulë|Ecthelion: saruman will still one-hit my shits
Aulë|Ecthelion: heros are too much better than upgrades, and this is from ur design of 1.7 tbh. Heros stronger
Valheru: we're getting there, at least we did a lot of upgrade accesibility stuff
Valheru: i like thr forge changes
Aulë|Ecthelion: yes that was excelent
Aulë|Ecthelion: men upgrades are lovely
Aulë|Ecthelion: but...
Aulë|Ecthelion: men heavy armor is nerfed since 1.05
Aulë|Ecthelion: while isen pike HA is improved by a damage scalar of 70, men HAs are nerfed by one of 120
Valheru: i thought u did some men stuff in 109
Aulë|Ecthelion: i did at first but it meant nothing
Aulë|Ecthelion: they had the damage scalars twice and i removed one
Aulë|Ecthelion: but game had never readed the two damage scalars anyways
Aulë|Ecthelion: i figured out too late and i didn't dare to buff at that stage of beta
Valheru: oh
Aulë|Ecthelion: maybe... if blacksmith was even cheaper
Aulë|Ecthelion: and heavy armor was on level 1
Aulë|Ecthelion: like with eregion forge
Aulë|Ecthelion: there would be no need to buff the stats
Valheru: is it shit on rohs?
Aulë|Ecthelion: alone ye
Aulë|Ecthelion: but rohirrims are usually with eomer leadership
Aulë|Ecthelion: which is basicaly a better heavy armor
Valheru: gay system
Aulë|Ecthelion: but if eomer was 33%
Aulë|Ecthelion: and upgrades were trully 50%
Aulë|Ecthelion: that would be the same
Aulë|Ecthelion: vs factions without debuff
Valheru: do that if u want, throw himo exp if he doesnt have it
Valheru: i gna play game of dota
Aulë|Ecthelion: that game still exists'
Valheru: ye very rarely play
Valheru: u cunts taking all my time with playing bfme
Valheru: lol
Aulë|Ecthelion: when are you gonna unnistall that garbage bra
Valheru: bra i seeing some big atak trol reps
Valheru: val proud
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea they are pretty fine
Aulë|Ecthelion: but MT are better, and you finally saw it i think
Aulë|Ecthelion: u got rektd by them
Valheru: that pisd me off lol, had nothin in base, game was won
Aulë|Ecthelion: lel
Aulë|Ecthelion: trollcage armor is also farm armor
Aulë|Ecthelion: that's why pikes can't counter it
Aulë|Ecthelion: 4 SH trollcage is basicaly a perfect opening
Valheru: but is it psychological, are ppl actually tring with swords>? probs dont know
Aulë|Ecthelion: u can't try with swords
Aulë|Ecthelion: because you get crushed, that simple
Aulë|Ecthelion: lel
Aulë|Ecthelion: and the little orc boys in the mordor barricades really like cavalry
Aulë|Ecthelion: but don't worry i just learnt this, next time i will pike+sword glute ;)
Valheru: i like where we have all troll types atm, fuk im amazing
Valheru: dnt wori about cage bra, the crush nerfs is enuf
Aulë|Ecthelion: drummers not so popular
Valheru: i think thats a knowledge thing tho
Valheru: i seen glute n ryan use
Valheru: kep em close to other trol
Aulë|Ecthelion: ah btw
Aulë|Ecthelion: i wanted to send you replays
Aulë|Ecthelion: i prepared a "lame for val" folder
Aulë|Ecthelion: did i send you that already?
Valheru: preti sure i watched em all, check facebook msg date
Aulë|Ecthelion: did you find trolls and ling action?
Valheru: i cant remember hoinestly my medication rly shits on my memory
Valheru: lings seem fine tho?
Valheru: i havent seen any real abuse
Aulë|Ecthelion: ok lel
Aulë|Ecthelion: will later chek reps
Aulë|Ecthelion: well, they are definetively lame in big maps
Aulë|Ecthelion: because you can't punish inmediatly
Valheru: one of those units thats either broken or shit, but i think we prety close to perfect
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea not perfect definetively
Aulë|Ecthelion: but i think we already nerfed them a bit on actual beta
Valheru: 2 much iu th ink i did
Valheru: * i think
Valheru: i dnt think pierce is the problem after playing a bit
Aulë|Ecthelion: nah, that's a fine measure
Aulë|Ecthelion: but what i consider a extrem nerf is lurtz
Aulë|Ecthelion: like i said yesterday
Aulë|Ecthelion: Elves vs Isen is actually balanced if it wasn't because of devastation+saruman combos
Aulë|Ecthelion: Isen vs Gob also pretty balanced on 1.09, althought requires a very agressive gameplay
Aulë|Ecthelion: i don't even see the point of nerfing even more against specific shelob
Aulë|Ecthelion: Gandy survives lurtz cripple, but ofc some nerf is more than welcome

Valheru: fuk now that im playing i dont want to patch
Valheru: lol
Aulë|Ecthelion: good
Aulë|Ecthelion: better
Aulë|Ecthelion: but if you find a cancerouos situation u want to stop playing and patch, like it happened me 3 hours ago
Aulë|Ecthelion: with scorp isen :P
Valheru: i think industry should reduce armor by 15%
Aulë|Ecthelion: na, bad idea
Aulë|Ecthelion: your SH seemed stronk
Aulë|Ecthelion: because the SH is stronk
Aulë|Ecthelion: or mordor barricades too effective
Valheru: i think its cooldown issue
Valheru: n its about time we nerf hobbits
Valheru: i just want a small hp nerf
Valheru: powers are ok now
Aulë|Ecthelion: the heros
Aulë|Ecthelion: meatshield against the arrows
Valheru: im referring to non hero
Aulë|Ecthelion: without heros the little hordes die pretty ez
Valheru: also tom is gay, i dont know why u added LD, he is so strong for tier 2
Valheru: sometimes does more than 15pp
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea tom OP
Aulë|Ecthelion: but leadership is good
Aulë|Ecthelion: it's for elf only
Valheru: i alrdy nerfed punch radius
Aulë|Ecthelion: ye that was perfect
Valheru: but i would like to see him killable
Aulë|Ecthelion: yes
Aulë|Ecthelion: that.
Aulë|Ecthelion: armies always prefer to dodge him
Valheru: so do we want to make him deal less dmg to pikes, or take big crush revenge
Valheru: one hits everything
Aulë|Ecthelion: crush revenge thing no
Aulë|Ecthelion: i would like if swords
Aulë|Ecthelion: dealt a fuckin something on him
Aulë|Ecthelion: since he already one hits them
Valheru: nvr looked at his armorset tbh
Aulë|Ecthelion: it's similar to shelob
Aulë|Ecthelion: or mounted mos
Valheru: slash 25%
Aulë|Ecthelion: he could also take hero
Valheru: its useless tho for factions like mordor, mostly t1 heroes
Aulë|Ecthelion: ye
Valheru: we can just nerf pierce slash anmd pike
Aulë|Ecthelion: if we nerf to pierce
Aulë|Ecthelion: LA kills him
Aulë|Ecthelion: and if we nerf uruk (orc damage)
Aulë|Ecthelion: uruk kill him flanking while he walks
Valheru: it wont be that big of a nerf, hes got big hp
Valheru: still big punch too
Aulë|Ecthelion: oh, and cavalry
Aulë|Ecthelion: also, this whole armorset kind
Aulë|Ecthelion: is too strong to cavalry
Valheru: ill test 20% nerf to those and see if he can die
Aulë|Ecthelion: shelob one hits all kind of cavalry
Aulë|Ecthelion: and takes almost zero dmg from things like lancers knights rohirim etc
Valheru: bcoz cant dismount like evrythiung else
Valheru: but can nerf a bit
Valheru: also i wana give an elf hero some sort of pillage power
Aulë|Ecthelion: fitton once came to me with that request :p
Aulë|Ecthelion: all factions have a economy thing
Aulë|Ecthelion: except his beloved elfs
Valheru: and isen have like 5 or some shit
Aulë|Ecthelion: but i don't want promote hero dependency for elfs
Aulë|Ecthelion: maybe improve mallorn productivity / armor?
Aulë|Ecthelion: oh... and talking about armors
Aulë|Ecthelion: did you know some barrracks have farm armor?
Valheru: orc pit?
Aulë|Ecthelion: and gob cave
Aulë|Ecthelion: i learned that reading 2.02 changelog
Valheru: ye coz guardians piss on it in 2 hits
Aulë|Ecthelion: all this years i have been wasting pikes
Aulë|Ecthelion: on gob caves
Aulë|Ecthelion: i thought it was that you overbuffed cave hp rofl
Valheru: i am not sure when that happened, but ive a feeling its not been changed since game launch
Aulë|Ecthelion: never yeah
Aulë|Ecthelion: lel
Aulë|Ecthelion: may i suit all structures ingame?
Aulë|Ecthelion: if gob caves died by pikes it would actually help lategame balance
Aulë|Ecthelion: and also
Aulë|Ecthelion: can we nerf flanking bonus of cavalry
Aulë|Ecthelion: wargs one-hit guardian with heavy armor
Aulë|Ecthelion: oh,
Aulë|Ecthelion: i also have a good tool to fix that
Valheru: is that on weapon?
Valheru: i wouldnt touch other cav bcoz ur just promoting more hero gayness
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea
Valheru: things like witchking need flank penalty
Aulë|Ecthelion: come i want to show you

SilverBane`: grond needs nerf and be available on ringheroes mode only


<< Valheru joined the room >>
Valheru: Weapon WargCrush 350% bit overkill
Valheru: or u mean their hit?
Valheru: hit doesnt get flank bonus its only on armor iirc
Aulë|Ecthelion: ye that 350
Valheru: is that 106?
Aulë|Ecthelion: since 1.5 ye
Aulë|Ecthelion: rohirrim is also 350
Aulë|Ecthelion: but they don't have howl that buff crush dmg
Aulë|Ecthelion: anyways, let me show u current shit
Aulë|Ecthelion: make soldiers
<< Starting Game >>
<< Joining Players >>
<< Returned from Game >>
<< Aulë|Ecthelion Aborted Game >>
Aulë|Ecthelion: forgot to close 2nd spot
<< Starting Game >>
<< Joining Players >>
<< Returned from Game >>
Aulë|Ecthelion: ofc 20 is too big
Aulë|Ecthelion: i have pushed 13 or 17
Aulë|Ecthelion: on my branch
Aulë|Ecthelion: 13 ye
<< Valheru Aborted Game >>
Aulë|Ecthelion: did u even see the pull request?
Valheru: i personally think u should avoid that and reduce  warg flank
Valheru: or do both but start with smaller value like 7%
Aulë|Ecthelion: ye warg flank can be reduced eitherway
Aulë|Ecthelion: https://github.com/ValheruGR/BFME2/pull/4
Valheru: is that pike thing global?
Aulë|Ecthelion: obviuosly
Aulë|Ecthelion: there's no punish for having ur pikes on agresive
Aulë|Ecthelion: just a buff
Aulë|Ecthelion: and minimal penalty
Valheru: ill apporove it but change that 13 to a 7 and sort our wargs
Valheru: obv we wont know for sure til beta but be gentle to start
Aulë|Ecthelion: about that
Aulë|Ecthelion: if we being too carefully with this
Aulë|Ecthelion: why aren't we doing the same with lurtz?
Aulë|Ecthelion: 50% nerf from patch to patch
Aulë|Ecthelion: while he only looks op vs FoL heros
Aulë|Ecthelion: (i mean pin duration and cooldown)
Valheru: i nerfed his pin pretty heavy
Valheru: and want to remove armor bonus in carnage
Valheru: plus more exp required for pillage
Aulë|Ecthelion: did u know bt2dc increased carnage radius?
Aulë|Ecthelion: and also increased guardian exp awards?
Valheru: dno my memories fukd up
Aulë|Ecthelion: carnage thing didn't appaer in their changelog
Aulë|Ecthelion: they buffed zerks
Aulë|Ecthelion: and affect lurtz carnage
Valheru: i rly hate that hero, 1100g for 3k worth
Aulë|Ecthelion: i want to separate that carnage radius buff
Aulë|Ecthelion: on 1.09 i separated it for dwarf units
Aulë|Ecthelion: i want to separate it for all 3 ranks hordes
Aulë|Ecthelion: staying big radius vs orcs and gobs
Valheru: sure
Valheru: and if we remove armor
Valheru: 2 much nerf vs elf?
Aulë|Ecthelion: yea
Aulë|Ecthelion: but radius restore on elf hordes will be good
Aulë|Ecthelion: atm faggot lurtz put in the middle of ur LA archers while they shoot something else
Aulë|Ecthelion: casts carnage and gg, u have to run
Aulë|Ecthelion: or he gets level 5 soon
Valheru: how abotu we try armor removed totally and see wot happens
Valheru: n u do ur carnage weapons
Valheru: at least th en its less faceroll, if lurtz goes carnage u can try focus
Aulë|Ecthelion: oh, and he needs penalty vs fortresses
Aulë|Ecthelion: nasty lurtz
Valheru: btw i saw in reps ur gay dworf heroes raping forts
Valheru: and tough hero armor is a joke vs fort fire
Aulë|Ecthelion: :d
Aulë|Ecthelion: dwarf can have some more penalty, but it has to be on the all the dwarf heros
Aulë|Ecthelion: not just gimli
Aulë|Ecthelion: to keep proportion
Valheru: jus a bit
Valheru: but the strucutual fort fite is useless
Aulë|Ecthelion: then glorfindel can also have vs fort
Valheru: even with fire arrows u have to focus every tower on em
Aulë|Ecthelion: actually
Aulë|Ecthelion: wanna improve fort vs hero dmg? lel
Valheru: gud idea
Aulë|Ecthelion: but i would like fort expansions
Aulë|Ecthelion: took a bit more hero dmg
Aulë|Ecthelion: they take less than the fort itself lol
Valheru: why one horde kills in 2s
Aulë|Ecthelion: horde. not a hero
Valheru: n ur gay hobbits
Aulë|Ecthelion: most of the times i just want to take down the towers with my dwarf heros
Valheru: alls ur doing is making the fort hero armor buff useless
Aulë|Ecthelion: and ends up being more effective to directly take the fort down
Valheru: na fuk that its gaymode
Valheru: i am sorting out whirlwind
Aulë|Ecthelion: and move it to a higher level for cow sake
Valheru: ye mybe or exp req
Valheru: and also i nerfing slayer to aragorn
Aulë|Ecthelion: why u want it on level 5
Aulë|Ecthelion: it looks bad
Valheru: its k radius going downa bit
Aulë|Ecthelion: and keep it on lvl 7
Aulë|Ecthelion: nerfed or not!
Aulë|Ecthelion: ah
Aulë|Ecthelion: Valheru: why one horde kills in 2s
Aulë|Ecthelion: about tower expansions
Aulë|Ecthelion: actually swords don't really kill it
Aulë|Ecthelion: pikemen do
Aulë|Ecthelion: stupid pikmene who are also the toughest units against structural dmg
Valheru: is it
Aulë|Ecthelion: also, Fortress silverthorn and Dwarf blue axes
Aulë|Ecthelion: are double structural dmg right
Aulë|Ecthelion: look this:
Aulë|Ecthelion: Armor PikemenHeavyArmor
Aulë|Ecthelion:   Armor = STRUCTURAL   20%
Aulë|Ecthelion:     Armor = FLAME               75%
Aulë|Ecthelion: that means 2-3 upgraded pikes can take down all towers (or the fortress) without die
Aulë|Ecthelion: which happened in the replay you made silver
Aulë|Ecthelion: while if it was any other fort with fire, pikes 'd die
Valheru: so wots solution
Aulë|Ecthelion: dwarf fort needs some kind of compensation in lategame vs pikes
Aulë|Ecthelion: and all tower expansions need to take less pikemen
Aulë|Ecthelion: and more swordmen
Aulë|Ecthelion: i mean hero
Aulë|Ecthelion: not swordmen
Valheru: ud have to nerf forge blade weapons to dworf fort
Valheru: coz u cant rly buff against armor upgrades
Aulë|Ecthelion: exacctly
Aulë|Ecthelion: but fort dying doesn't worry me
Aulë|Ecthelion: worries me all my barracks dying vs upgraded pikes
Aulë|Ecthelion: and my blue axes of fort not doing shit on them
Valheru: why dont u just increase fort upg towers base dmg
Valheru: their shit anmyway
Valheru: elf dworf
Aulë|Ecthelion: it's double base dmg
Aulë|Ecthelion: structural dmg counters very well balrog
Aulë|Ecthelion: (better than magic)
Valheru: so just nerf uruk pike FB then
Valheru: structure penalty globally
Valheru: do wargs while ur at it
Aulë|Ecthelion: wat i do to them?
Aulë|Ecthelion: 275% flanking bonus from 350?
Aulë|Ecthelion: would be the average of 200% (knight) and 350
Valheru: yeh but i talking forge blades too, structural penalty in weapon
Valheru: like we did with corsairs
Valheru: fukj they were gay
Valheru: i hate it how as soon as isen upgrades appear its steamroll
Valheru: mostly pike
Valheru: and 2 wargs with FB on fort
Valheru: love seeing rohs do it but thats late game as shit
Aulë|Ecthelion: also warg HA stronger to structural than to fire
Aulë|Ecthelion: bad vs dwarf
Aulë|Ecthelion: it occured to me
Aulë|Ecthelion: giving FLAME damage type to upgraded axes
Valheru: oh ye gud idea
Aulë|Ecthelion: but that would kill the diversity
Aulë|Ecthelion: and it would be weird mines get raped :P
Aulë|Ecthelion: ohh
Aulë|Ecthelion: bane gave me idea
Aulë|Ecthelion: SilverBane`: should only stay vs infantry
Aulë|Ecthelion: we can have both dmg types
Aulë|Ecthelion: fak, good good
Valheru: right
Valheru: i need timeout
Valheru: im guna do haradrim fire arrows too
Valheru: but u can do the stats 4 it
Aulë|Ecthelion: it's already coded eh
Aulë|Ecthelion: dont need any model
Aulë|Ecthelion: just enable
Valheru: is it in the model alrdy, have u seen
Valheru: fire tips
Aulë|Ecthelion: yes i think
Aulë|Ecthelion: enable and chek
Valheru: k im off ill look at ur new stuff 2nite


Farmer Lau: shelob 1 shots any cav, kills heroes with stinger, disrupts yo army, swords die, bows are whatever unless u make millions
Farmer Lau: and shes got a v8 engine

QuickShot20: Cave troll Goblin throw:what about giving it a scalar regardless against towers in next patch =D

mordor walls can't be repaired?


GranThorino: alright there's a hint
GranThorino: udun's so popular for two reasons:
GranThorino: the skin = all units are perfectly visible, it's not messy and confusing
GranThorino: second is the fact that the base is not in the corners, tehre's still some space left behind it, therefore you can fight even behind it or encircle it with dwarven mines
GranThorino: most maps have no space behind bases
GranThorino: forts are right next to the edge of the map
GranThorino: which is case of Emyn Arnen

-All houses of healing radius now 225 from 250.
-Lorien archer Silverthorn arrows now deal 50% to cavalry from 12.5%. (Consider the double damage gain issue was fixed on 1.09). Originally 100%.

Revert my crush buff of 1.09. Damage is fine. And maybe even consider reducing their poisonous crush revenge weapon....]]

									if
										options 1 and 2.

									men elf			Gondor soldiers shields now yes can be strenghted without become op on Land. All men units stop being Wood dependent. HA penalties can be gone.
									men dwarf		Good game dynamics for both factions. Wood less op early game Gimli less op middle game.
									men isen		Lone towers can have a purpose now if debuff drives me crazy. I WOULD LIKE THEODEN became one of this new Stacky spell leaderships.
									men gob			Good for gobs. And if we give men a Stacky Spell
									men mordor		Good for mordor. MEN NEEDS A STACKY SPELL. BOROMIR / THEODEN BEING THE SAME IS BAD.
									elf dwarf		 Good. Tier 2 elf wood should have any kind of compensation...
									elf isen		Arwen now yes can be properly effective with lancers. Good. Tier 2 elf wood should have any kind of compensation...
									elf gob				No more bullshit of SR in defensive stance with land crushing pikes. SR pike armor can be slightly restored to pikes again. Arwen now yes can be properly effective with lancers.
									elf mordor			Elf suffer too much from taint land. Not anymore, but only this mu worries me. ORCS CAN BE BUFFED AGAIN THO
									dwarf isen			I have chances vs debuff with wagon+dain, and gimli is less necesary. Happy.
									dwarf mordor		Orcs in defensive stance with land have always been a pain in the ass for early game. Gimli armor nerfed so also good here.
									dwarf gob			If debuff drives me cracy i can get Dain+Wagon stacking. Excelent. Also gimli less OP which is welcomed by all match ups.
									isen vs gob			Promotes gorkil vs isen, which is not usual. Taint land irrelevant here.
									isen vs mordor		Taint land less op, promotes eye. I like this.
									mordor vs gob		I like goblin now have a leadership to survive naz debuff.
