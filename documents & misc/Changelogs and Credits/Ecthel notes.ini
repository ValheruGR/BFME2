sauron looks seriously homosexual in high lod. did you do that in purpose?




we had a nice FX_FearBlastRiderWK, why u made a new laggy FX_FearBlastRiderWKonfoot?











equivalent to sirve para escalars tambien.

Grima debuff looks like shit and it's having influence over the incorrect nugget display bug, for nothing. cuz bats
WK SCREECH ON FLOOR HAS THE HEIGH OF MOUNTED WK. WHICH BASICALY DOESNT LET U SEE A SHIT.




 ;Valheru: anfalas is good but it needs neutral lairs next to outpost/signal
 ;Valheru: Arnor is alright but its snow, and not sure if anyone will play it given narrow passages and uneven terrain
 ;Valheru: canyons of khand is alright, dont think it will be popular but its gud enuf
	Valheru: however some terrain goes over fort floors, needs slight flatten at start positions
	E: silver said chokepoints are lame
	E: camera is weird but can be fixed
	E: if worths it.
	Valheru: yeh lets keep it tho
;Valheru: i love druadan forrest but outposts have no lairs
Valheru: add neutrals and itl be great map
E: i added these outposts actually
E: map was too big and i wanted to add these 2 places of player focus
Valheru: yeah but uncontesed outposts is gaymode
E: maybe i get silver to add something in the 4 corners of the map
E: like rivers or something
E: to make the playable area smaller
Valheru: i l ike it but plz add warg lairs
E: k
;Valheru: emyn muil is ok, boring but different terrain
Valheru: can keep it
E: idk why everyone say textures are nice
E: it feels like a udun to me
;Valheru: i like endewatih but bottom right position has advantage, bottleneck bridges
E: also ea map
Valheru: and dark lighting
Valheru: ok can we at least improve lighting then
;Valheru: Eregion is beautiful but the slopes make archers gay as shit
Valheru: id like to fix that because otherwise its nice
 ;Valheru: fords of rohan is good but has 2 uncontested signals
 ;Valheru: greenleaf forrest is so beautiful but replace lings with wargs
Valheru: i fukjing hate lings they rape builders
Valheru: and get units stuck
 Valheru: harad is fine but instead of 2 goblin lairs near outposts, just put 1 right next to it. The lairs are too close to base, awful for FoD
 Valheru: Westmarch is a good size but theres outposts right next to base. Move them somewhere futher away and add warg lairs
Valheru: alrdy spoke about moonglade
E: ye
E: we played a game there yesterday
E: that map is seriously beautiful
E: but pretty annoying
E: i have been working to make a clearer minimap
;Valheru: Nan marillion is nice but lighting too vibrant
 Valheru: cool
Valheru: rhovannian steps is great
Valheru: but add a central signal and some wargs
 Valheru: can fit 1 in, if u can tolerate a trash ally
Valheru: :)

	SilverNoob map review
		woody end - maybe some fix on cliff textures, but alright
		wilderland - X - bad map, outpost abuse and nub textures
		slopes of ered engrin - X - texture choice is awful for grass/cliff area, and layout looks pretty dumb. id remove it
 		 river of orodruin - looks pretty nice
		rhun shore - might be alright
		rhovanion steppes - beautiful
 		 raven pass - looks alright except cliffs. noob cliffs
		paths of dead - i love it! but i smell noob gameplay cuz too narrow. X
		nan elmoth - X - nub ugly map, also kinda narrow
		mithlond valley - BIG X - retardedly narrow only a bridge between teams and a narrow path on top
		mirkwood forest - X imo - literally gay, pink ambient color and gey design
		midgewater - thyrn gorthad 2.0 its ok i guess
		lamedon - beautiful! i actually like this one (except top cliff textures) for 4v4
		ironhills 2,3,4 - X imo - sucky gameplay and gay design
		imladris - X - nub map
		gundabad pass - big X - nub map
		fords of rohan - we played it. nice texture, dumb name and side fords too narrow
		fords of harnen - i played this one in rotwk. i like it, and rlly beautiful textures
		ered mithrin - X nub map
		ered luin valley - :OOOOO never seen a map with those textures outside campaign. but i guess its kinda narrow and retarded
		erech 2 - i like textures alot, but dumb layout. narrower middle and NOOB cliffs (stretched texture on cliffs)
		emyn arnen ffa - beautiful but tall cliffs with grass texture looks kinda dumb. wouldnt mind tho
		dwarrowdelf - X imo - looks retarded, especially mid. also 2 big
		dungeons of erebor - X but mid is so beautiful. but player bases look odd and ugly in my oppinion with those rugs. i would personally remove this one
		druwaith reef - looks strange but its ok i guess
		dorwinion - beautiful but huge for 1v1. also, i hate rock texture in the city. id say X but its beautiful otherwise
		dessert of rhun - X nub map. i played this many times in rotwk, nub retarded 4v4 map where 1 player is highground and super protected
		coast of nurnen - X - cheap copy of my sea of nurn, with ugly textures and ruin placement, also incredibly small farmspace for teams
		cape of nightfall - never played this one but i smell bad games, too little farm space and narrow city hill in mid. beautiful tho
		canyons of khand - we played it today. dont like the cliffs/highrounds/towers/chokepoints, camera is jerky. id say X
		brown lands 8p - i like this map, both this and 6p version. but needs to be flattened cuz u cant place farms
		blackroot vale - X - ugly confusing green everywhere (not even paths) and ugly large river in mid. only waterfall unplayable side is beauiful
		 


	Valheru: ill just ask to use, not guna say about edits coz noone will care
	Valheru: Westmarch is a good size but theres outposts right next to base. Move them somewhere futher away and add warg lairs




 Valheru: Sea of nurnen stunning
Valheru: but fix uncontested outposts









wk box too big







SLEEPING FOREST NEEDS DES


jungles of harad lighting

Valheru: westmarch is alrite but everyone starts with an Inn(no creep)
Valheru: yeh its a decent shape and stuff, terrains alrite, but not much happening. can u just put a warg or goblin lair in place of inns?


work as leadership icon for both dain and gimli. 
	-ICONS: saruman dominate icon is dumb. looks like some soul stealing thing. - 
		Yes idiot, because thats exactly what dominate does.
			;na, thats fanciful and gay like warcraft! even in the movie it's just a influence.





Valheru: ok u may aswell do Spire whilst ur coding
Valheru: mighty cata etc
Valheru: and witchking DBS














  gondor archer needs armor or health. 
 
You know that abusing of Scale = X thing you just fuck up selection boxes & nuggets right? (select boxes dont change, nuggets do)


   


	 
 

;;-------------------------Ecth.Notes----------------------;;
 	-QUESTION: I have the fix for dwarf heavy armor. They needed a production update module. Do you still want to make single purchase tiny upgrades, so the armor can be stronger!
	-QUESTION: In rohan banner and knight banner there's a showsubobject module triggered by Upgrade_DwarvenMithrilMail, which is not granted anywhere. Does this mean u had an HD model for mounted banners which is not showing up?
	-ICONS: the Only icon that has sucked bad since the beggining of bfme1 is boromir Train Allies and you still haven't fixed that.
	-ICONS: I think dain's Train allies icon will work as leadership icon for both dain and gimli. 
 	-ICONS: saruman dominate icon is dumb. looks like some soul stealing thing.
		;Yes idiot, because thats exactly what dominate does.
			na, thats fanciful and gay like warcraft! even in the movie it's just a influence.
	-ICONS: make saruman blast icon more purple instead of blue. check its FX!
	-ICONS: the two arrow powers of legolas suck dick.
	-ICONS: grima icons are cancer
	-MODELS.fortress eagle needs unique skin to distinguish from summones
	-MODELS. that tree model with treebeard legs is shit. 
	-MODELS. make a easterling model with larger pike... and less shitty.
 	-MODELS. HARD TO distinguish GONDOR ARCHER FORM SOLDIER. BANNER CARRIERS WITH SHIELD BAD IDEA. both models are also a bit too grey i think.
	-MODELS. level 2 & level 3 isen floors are barely differencibla. I MISS ORANGE WITH ALL MY HEART
 	-MODELS: gimli cape still looks retarded!	
	-MODELS: -corsair house color looks noob
	-FXS: gandalf wop made glute crahs
	-FXS: Can you make farsight4 sound shorter?
	-FXS: SUNFLARE LOOKS STUPID IF NO FX TOUCHES THE GROUND. 
	-FXS. Make eowyn spear thrown slightly different than eomers. Like more gold than eomers.
  	-FXS. We still having the bug of game confusing BuffNugggets, can u delete some? Both Athelas spells can be pure particlesystem. 
		FX_AragornAthBTP
		FX_ElrondAth is beautiful but im sure u can make a particle like these you added on this beta.
		FX_ElrondHealSpecialPower can be a fx. no need to be a nugget of 5secs for 1 power.
		FX_GenericDebuff25Grima absolutely unnecesary. 
	-FXS: Horde Respawn needs to be differenced from Fortress/Well respawn again. Perhaps a rainbow is not a big deal considering it's 2 colors per faction.
	-FXS. MakeDoubt FX purple instead of black/wine? match with icon and debuff nugget. 
		- OK I WILL
	-FXS: Make DISSENT FX morgul green? and a new icon with a green like the old one?!?!?!?!?!!?!? epik
	-FXS: Linear FX for gloin slam? some craks on the ground that make sense regard the hammer animation..
	-FXS: wk mounted death fx is playing in dismounted wk, unless u intentionaly wanted floating shit.
 	-FXS: Gloin EQ is synchronized like shit.
	-FXS: nobody liking mystic fountain piss
	-FXS. mighty catapult fx lookss like shit. the metaimpact ruins everything cuz u made it big per projectile. so whoever hits first is puting in the air the guys before the other rocks touch ground. -DELAY THE FIRST ROCKS WEAPON
	-FXS: is it me or RC fx is ruined with these metalic white fxs?
	-DESIGN: can we nerf Flyers plow weapon to avoid one hiting strong units inside tunnel.
 	-DESIGN: poison arrow dmg bonus vs heroes
	-DESIGN: shelob still way too effective to counter ur beloeved trolls - OK NERF HER VS TROLL
 	-DESIGN: RC TO 35% EXP?
 	-DESIGN: I 'd like to reduce heroes leadership radius again. Debuff stuff still counters them effectively and only rapes violentally the balance vs factions without debuff. Simple dmg/armor ones at least (theo lurtz haldir). They are 275 and originally 200. I propose 225. - OK
	-BOXES: mordor catapult select box too big
	-BOXES: rivendel lancer banner select box is bigger than the horde itself. it's kinda annoying when you are trying to aim the lvl 1 horde, in case it's a group of 2-3lancers.
	-BOXES: Fellbeast & WK mounted select box too big! fix fix fix! It's due the wings. eagle&drogoth dont't have select box in wings. - having weird issues trying to fix this
  		
;;------------------------Val.Notes--------------------;;

 		-Beserkers need a new model entirely.
 		- wagon heal could be a tiny bit higher 
			;tbh i only care they survive something in level 1 when crushing. You need 2-3 wagon to crush a highranked bunch of archers with leadership and ANY kind of heroe near. Wagons are op once you have a group of 4-5 highranked ones.
		- wagons Heavy Armor upgrade? 
			;would be unfair if spider rider didn't have it. but that would be gey modding already.
		- Knights levels 1-3 exp.
			;wat about that? u want more or less? 
		-lots of spells look awful at 460 zoom or whatever it is. I designed them all on 560 height
			;i would keep insisting with 450 zooms tbh.
		-val notes from reps: The trail fx bit too bright too
 	
			
			


;;------------------------.Feedback----------------------;;
	-DESIGN. Elrond Tornado
		SilverBane`: i strongly support bringing tornado back to lv10!
		SilverBane`: and make it stronk
		SilverBane`: like 1.6
		SilverBane`: or atleast lv8-9 if val is too stubborn. lv5-6 is just too damn early elrond lvls up very quickly
		Ecth: it was actually meant to be lvl 7
		Ecth: since the idea was to simply swap
		Ecth: tornado with restore
		SilverBane`: restore is not even half as powerful as tornado tbh
		Ecth: only in TW
		Ecth: xd
		SilverBane`: it refreshes what? hawk strike? rain of arrows? only if u have thrandu lv10 and haldir its useful
		(...)
 		THE_GLUTEMASTER: elronds tornado is delayed when you use it?
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: or was it just lag?
		SilverBane`: its the new anims for spells thing
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: what?
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: everytime I used it
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: I clicked on it
		SilverBane`: every ability pretty much got new anims
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: and he used it 5 secs latter
		SilverBane`: that delay spell use
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: tornado feels too weak now tbh
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: since he dont get it in level 5 anymore
		SilverBane`: i think tornado on lv6 is dumb tbh
		SilverBane`: its a lv10 spell that should be powerful
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: I rather have that
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: it feels a bit useless now
		<< Guerrilla joined the room >>
		Guerrilla: i can obs?
		Guerrilla: to deep my feet into val patch
		Fischer-Dieskau...): U WOULD HAVE TO DOWNLOAD IT
		Guerrilla: omg beta stuff that will break my lovely 1.06
		Guerrilla: D:
		Fischer-Dieskau...): elrond himself needs to complete like 1 second and half of animation
		Fischer-Dieskau...): then tornado spawn
		Guerrilla: omg thats just shit senor
		Fischer-Dieskau...): not instant
		Guerrilla: atleast for tw
		Fischer-Dieskau...): haha,, i learned it in the Tw
		Fischer-Dieskau...): and put it on beta
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: That was very annoying :D
		SilverBane`: i agree these new anims make heros spells pretty useless
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: I missed all tornado
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: because of that
		Fischer-Dieskau...): consider it a nerf
		Fischer-Dieskau...): stupid elrond
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: yes
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: but
		Guerrilla: well i think once you learn it
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: when you use it
		Guerrilla: you understand
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: its also weaker
		Fischer-Dieskau...): ye now u have to calculate a bit
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: too much nerf
		Fischer-Dieskau...): beore it was a instant cast
		Fischer-Dieskau...): like u rally call
		Fischer-Dieskau...): and yes val nerfed dmg and radius
		Fischer-Dieskau...): like crazy
		Guerrilla: so basically you have to pretend you are playing with super lag
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: too stupid
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: its useless now
		SilverBane`: i wouldnt mind new anims but theres such thing as offhost delay
		SilverBane`: i cant bear both of them at once
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: why nerf 3 things
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: actually 4
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: level6, not ussing it instant, less damage and range
		Guerrilla: yeah! you tell em jens!
		SilverBane`: tornado is level 10 spell imo
		SilverBane`: moving it on lv6 its just lame
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: I dont think I hit a single unit with it in last game :D
		Guerrilla: i have told bunito before to leave val and make his own patch
		SilverBane`: makes elf even more annoying while trivialising the spell
		Guerrilla: but he says he does not have the leadership
		SilverBane`: elf needs good old lancer and good archer positioning, less hero spam
		SilverBane`: tornado on level 5-6 is gay
		SilverBane`: even if its weak
		SilverBane`: make it lv10 but strong
		Guerrilla: jens you would be better off playing Udun II with your best m8 guerrilla
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: No doubt about that
		Guerrilla: and second best m8 farmer lau
		THE_GLUTEMASTER: yes!
		Guerrilla: no eagle on udun 2
		SilverBane`: theres some things that cant be fixed in map.ini about 1.06, such as gob powerpoint feeding
		SilverBane`: which i highly detest
		Guerrilla: i was beating crow one game 1.06
		(...)
 	-FXS. 
		SilverBane`: i didnt like new gloin shatter hammer fx
		SilverBane`: the old 1.9 one is loads better
		SilverBane`: too much abuse of shake screen and earth particles move too slow on the air
 		(...)
	-MODELS
 		BorisJohnson™: Don't all these HD models lag the game too much?
		Farmer Lau: some models look like theyve been retardified to be honest
		(...)
 		BorisJohnson™: If you want to play in HD, why not just install the HD Edition?
		SilverBane`: models cant be fixed
		BorisJohnson™: Shouldn't have HD models forced on you if you don't want them.
		(...)
		SilverBane`: dw pikes look confusing
		SilverBane`: not as ez to distinguish
		SilverBane`: from guardian
		SilverBane`: i think normal models might be if u roll back model quality in settings to medium
		SilverBane`: but not sure
		King™: Nah, I play on low for online.
		King™: Still seeing all units in HD.,
		SilverBane`: i play ultra
		(...)
		King™: I'll sit out since there's a lag issue.

;;------------------------Balance.Theory------------------------;;
 			- RC 120s CD
			- Land lasts 270s
			-Land CD is 270s
			-Land Penalty 15% armor
			-Crebain/bats 150s CD, 50s duration
 			;Elves vs Men
				//EcthThoughts//: Gondor soldiers shields now yes can be strenghted without become op on Land. All men units stop being Wood dependent. HA penalties can be gone. Faramir / Eomer will be in a nasty position, but Legolas Thranduil ranged damage can be reduced into the average of 1.06 and 1.09 values.
 				-Men wood cooldown buffed
				-Men Wood duration buffed
				-Men wood radius buffed
				-Men wood lost 15% armor
				-The real effects of the wood buffs dont really kick in til after the first recharge. Area buff is tiny, and the lifetime buff is only noticeable at the end of the first spell. So the hardest part of the 15% armor loss for men is the first 4 minutes of the game.
				-Since these first 4 minutes are often the most important, Men will require scalars on elven weapons, small numbers.
				-SoG have 5% shield wall buff but this is not immediately applicable 
  			;Men vs Mordor
				//EcthThoughts//: Good for mordor. MEN NEEDS A STACKY SPELL. BOROMIR / THEODEN BEING THE SAME IS BAD.
 				- I dont think any changes are neccesary here until proper beta happens. Both factions have buffs that are outside of the land armor nerfs
 			;Men vs Dwarves
 				//EcthThoughts//: Good game dynamics for both factions. Wood less op early game Gimli less op middle game. Hero spam not so unstoppeable, warf army not so unstoppeable.
 				- Land nerfs hurt men here, but SoG got bonus to dwarf mines, shield wall buff, and SoG specialist buff(easier creep jacks). I would take an educated guess that Guardians will need a small nerf to SoG/TG/GA
 			;Men vs Isengard
				//EcthThoughts//: Lone towers can have a purpose now if debuff drives me crazy. I WOULD LIKE THEODEN became one of this new Stacky spell leaderships.
 				- Crebain 10s less lifetime, and usually negates Mens land the first time round. Other land buffs will help a lot here. Warg nerfs, shield wall buff, Uruk Hai block nerf and nerf to farm. Not changing anything til beta happens
 			;Men Vs Goblins
 				- Both got same land changes, but gobs usually take bats and men land. Shield wall buff useful here
				//EcthThoughts//: Good for gobs. And if we give men a Stacky Spell
 			;Mordor vs Isengard
				//EcthThoughts//: Taint land less op, promotes eye. I like this.
 				- No changes neccesary upfront as both factions have buffs/nerfs outside of taint land armor nerf. Plus eye/wc is common
 			;Mordor vs Elves
				//EcthThoughts//: Elf suffer too much from taint land. Not anymore, but only this mu worries me. ORCS CAN BE BUFFED AGAIN THO
 				- Land armor nerf hurts here. Hordebonus was buffed though to pierce. But LA will require scalars to Orc Warriors mostly, perhaps a tiny bit to orc archers.
 			;Mordor vs Dwarves
				//EcthThoughts//: Orcs in defensive stance with land have always been a pain in the ass for early game. Gimli armor nerfed so also good here.
 				- Land armor nerf wont affect it much as taking land vs dwarves sucks dick
 			;Mordor vs Goblins
				//EcthThoughts//: I like goblin now have a leadership to survive naz debuff. 
 				- no changes neccesary upfront
 			;Goblins vs Dwarves
 				- taint land sucks dick vs Dwarves, no changes needed upfront
				//EcthThoughts//: If debuff drives me cracy i can get Dain+Wagon stacking. Excelent. Also gimli less OP which is welcomed by all match ups.
 			;Goblins vs Elves
 				- no changes needed upfront
				//EcthThoughts//: No more bullshit of SR in defensive stance with land crushing pikes. SR pike armor can be slightly restored to pikes again. Arwen now yes can be properly effective with lancers.
 			;Goblins vs Isengard
				//EcthThoughts//: Promotes gorkil vs isen, which is not usual. Taint land irrelevant here.
 				- Land pretty uncommon as 1st power, plus uruks got nerfed so did wargs, no changes needed. If anything, Isengard might need help in this mu.
			;Elves vs Dwarves
 				//EcthThoughts//: Good. Tier 2 elf wood should have any kind of compensation...
			;Elves vs Isengard 
 				//EcthThoughts//: Arwen now yes can be properly effective with lancers. Good. Tier 2 elf wood should have any kind of compensation...<
			;Dwarves vs Isengard
				//EcthThoughts//: I have chances vs debuff with wagon+dain, and gimli is less necesary. Happy.

	-I test later if upgraded condition is actually read. The code has always been there but BannerHeavyArmor did not exists in armor.ini lel. 
		-Doesn work. I anote later.
 	-pippin merry don't actually shoot in treebeard. even if i put them in rockmode.
	-https://www.gamereplays.org/community/index.php?showtopic=1010078&pid=10115134&st=0&#entry10115134
	-ai for ring heross
	-Crossbow OP vs FoL. 
 	-soldiers still suck, pierce might still needing to go 140% from 150%. (1.6 they took 125%). 
		-Depends on if we change leaderships.
	-soldiers in block formation could have a 315 FrontAngle, so only 45º from behind are one-hiteables.
		-Depends on if we change leaderships.
	-troll cage floor in level 1 looks upgraded when it's not. can't tell if level 1 or level 2 i think.
 	-Drogoth* autoheal nugget looks too bad. I think it's because your lazzy scale in it's object.
