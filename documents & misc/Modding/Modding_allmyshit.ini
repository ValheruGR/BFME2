DamageTaperOff means minimun damage per area. It's damage, not a percentage.
DamageTaperOff is affected by modifiers. Either additives or multiplicatives.


S
If 350 damage in 100 radius and damagetaperoff of 350 means no change.
as lower, it begins losing damage in the most far part of the area of damage.
damage taper off of 35 means 10% in the farest area. (this is not just distance but the sides of a Triangle made by DamageArc also)



	MeleeWeapon = Yes // this is what makes unit autoattack after clicking a target. very important i think. Wyrm attack once and stop without it.

difference between ANY and NONE

ANY +HEROE +STRUCTURE = means it works on structures and also heroes.
NONE +HEROE +STRUCTURE = means it will work on a object with BOTH this kind ofs. Won't work on heroes, won't work on structures.

This is tested and means a lot of 1.06 scalars never worked, like this. 
LegolasHawkstrike's "10% NONE +STRUCTURE +MordorCatapult +IsengardBallista +GondorTrebuchet +GondorTrebuchetWall" =  broken.
Lots of 1.09 scalars, and the worst part of everything, all scalars/filters of beta =D
easy to fix since we code thinking it works with the "ANY" mode, but fixing it globaly means "enable" some broken 1.6/1.9 scalars. the hard work is to log it.



Ok Specificfilters are the exception.

	They are always read as if you were using ANY for them.

	NONE +STRUCTURE +HERO +ElvenLegolas 

	effect vs structures doesn't work, and vs heroes doesn't work. But it works vs Legolas.

DAMAGE taken according ARMOR_MODIFIER
	(ARMOR_COEFFICIENT) - (ARMOR_MODIFIER of ARMOR_COEFFICIENT)	= DAMAGE_TAKEN
	(100)				- (		40%		  of 100			  )	= 60%
	(100)				- (		75%		  of 100			  )	= 25%
	(100)				- (	   -25%		  of 100			  )	= 125%

Formula
Convert DAMAGE_MULT into ARMOR_ADD
	((-100 * ((100/D)-1)	= A
	((-100 * ((100/143)-1)	= 30
	((-100 * ((100/500)-1)	= 80
 
Convert ARMOR_ADD into DAMAGE_MULT
Formula
	(100 + (100 / ((100/A)-1))	= D
	(100 + (100 / ((100/50)-1))	= 200
	(100 + (100 / ((100/75)-1))	= 400
	(100 + (100 / ((100/20)-1))	= 125
 
Example 1: 
	125 - (75% of 125) = 31.25. 
	Thus: gob take 125% pierce, but they take 31.25% if 75% armor.
Example 2: 
	120 - (-135% of 120) = 282. 
	Thus: guadian take 120% structural but with siege hammers, they take 282%.

	;
	;curiosity: haradrim archers have same HP and DMG as ithilien ranger, and the only armorset differences is haradrims take 300 crush and rangers 450 crush. but haradrims take 100% pierce and rangers 70%
	;
	;
	;The changes in comparison with original would be: basic meele damage became slow, with 1/4 more damage, area damage and a bunch of unnecesary scalars based on the double nugget error. Cost 1800 from 1500 and automatic crush desaceleration reduction bonus for rohirrims on level 7 for rohirrims. Maiden and disguise swaped. Spear gained radius dmg but double cooldown and uselessness vs mordor flyers. Also, spear became hero dmg with 50% bonus on evil heros. Maiden armor bonus nerfed a lot but added speed bonus... she sucks.
	;
	;
	;if farm takes less cavalry, means good vs elf and isen.  mirror dont care.
	;if SH takes more cavalry, means good vs elf, good vs isengard. Bad vs knights/rohirrim. Bad vs BW.
	;
	;lancer and warg deal too few dmg on slauher house
	;but they deal too much dmg on farms
	;
	;-for what i see, mordor slaugher houses deserve it's own armorset, which takes more cavalry damage (just like farm and mallorn do)
	;-BT2DC, WITH THE INTENTION OF BUFF HARADRIM ARCHERS AGAINST PIERCE, ENDED UP BUFFING GONDOR ARCHERS, ORC ARCHERS, AND DALE ARCHERS.
	;Dale archer buff is good----->Everyone happy and even it's not enough.
	;GONDOR archer buff is bad -----> broke men vs goblins mu in a worse away. --->reason of Val's 1.07 HP nerf. 
	;Mordor archer buff is bad -----> reason of mordor archers with horde bonus and taint land raping Lorien archers, whose never got pierce buff.----> here a -10% nerf. Average of bt2dc and 1.06 is always good.
	;
	;
	;
	;
	;;;=Its not happening now=;;-Removed marauder aditional +50% damage against cavalry. 
	;(Why ONLY marauders get this +50% buff, while the other pikes on the game not? Give it to phalanx and you will see how OP)
	;;;=Its not happening now=;;-Fixed marauder gaining double damage against cavalry.
	;;;=Its not happening now=;;--Marauder now deals FULL splash damage against cavalry. From 100 dmg on 0 radius, and 50 damage on 7.5 radius. 
	;(this means 100 splash damage, from 150 damage (third part of this damage was splash)
	;;;=Its not happening now=;;--Marauder pike radius now 6 from 7.5.
	;
	;;;explaination, at the begining, that was an excelent BT2DC change. But what happens if anyone casts warchant/darkness or just levels up the marauders, for example to rank 5? They end up with 120 damage by one side, and 70 damage by the other side, against cavalry. That's 190 damage, more than enough to one-hit most of the cavalry units.
